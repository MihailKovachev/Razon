>[!DEFINITION] Definition: Polynomial Equation
>
>A **polynomial equation** over a [field](../../Fields/index.md) $F$ is an [equation](../Equation.md) of the form
>
>$$
>P(x_1, \cdots, x_n) = 0_F,
>$$
>
>where $P(x_1, \cdots, x_n)$ is a [nonzero](../../Rings/Commutative%20Rings/Polynomials/Zero%20Polynomial.md) [polynomial](../../Rings/Commutative%20Rings/Polynomials/Polynomials.md).
>
>>[!DEFINITION] Definition: Solution of a Polynomial Equation
>>
>>A **solution** to the [polynomial equation](./index.md) $P(x_1, \cdots, x_n) = 0_F$ is an $n$-[Tuples](../../../Set%20Theory/Tuples.md) $S = (\lambda_1, \cdots, \lambda_n)$ of elements from $F$ such that the [value](../../Rings/Commutative%20Rings/Polynomials/Polynomials.md) of $P$ at $S$ is $0_F$.

>[!DEFINITION] Definition: Quadratic Equation

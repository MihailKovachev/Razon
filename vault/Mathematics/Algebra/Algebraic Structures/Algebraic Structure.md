>[!DEFINITION] Definition: Algebraic Structure
>
>An **algebraic structure** $(S, O, R)$ consists of a [non-empty](../../Set%20Theory/The%20Empty%20Set.md) [set](../../Set%20Theory/Set.md) $S$, a set $O$ of [operations](Operations/Operation.md) on $S$ and a finite set $R$ of rules which these operations must obey.
>
>>[!NOTE]
>>
>>The set $S$ is often called the **domain**, **carrier set** or **underlying set** of the algebraic structure.

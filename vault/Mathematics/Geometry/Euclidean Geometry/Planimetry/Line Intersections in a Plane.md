>[!THEOREM] Theorem: Lines in a Plane
>
>For every two distinct [straight lines](../Curves/Straight%20Lines/index.md) which lie in the same [plane](../Surfaces/Planes.md) there are two possibilities:
>
>- The lines intersect in a single [point](../Euclidean%20Space/Points%20vs%20Vectors/index.md).
>- The lines do not intersect.

>[!DEFINITION] Definition: Parallel Lines
>
>Two [straight lines](../Curves/Straight%20Lines/index.md) are **parallel** if they lie in the same [plane](../Surfaces/Planes.md) but do not [intersect](Line%20Intersections%20in%20a%20Plane.md).

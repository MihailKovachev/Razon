>[!THEOREM] Theorem: Derivative of the Real Tangent Function

>The [real tangent function](Real%20Tangent%20Function.md) is [differentiable](../../Differentiation/index.md) (everywhere it is defined) and its [derivative](../../Differentiation/index.md) is the recirpocal of the square of the [real cosine function](../Real%20Cosine%20Function/Real%20Cosine%20Function.md):

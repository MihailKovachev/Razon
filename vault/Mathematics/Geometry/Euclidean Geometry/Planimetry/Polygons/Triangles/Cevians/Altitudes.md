>[!DEFINITION] Definition: Altitude
>
>An **altitude** in a [triangle](../index.md) is a [line segment](../../../../Curves/Straight%20Lines/Line%20Segments.md) $h$ with the following properties:
>- The endpoints of $h$ are a [vertex](../../index.md) $V$ of the triangle and a [point](../../../../Euclidean%20Space/Points%20vs%20Vectors/index.md) on the [extension](../../../../Curves/Straight%20Lines/Line%20Segments.md) of the [side](../../index.md) $s$ opposite to $V$.
>- The segment $h$ is [perpendicular](../../../../Curves/Straight%20Lines/Angle%20between%20Lines.md) to the extension of $s$.
>
>>[!DEFINITION] Definition: Base
>>
>>The [side](../../index.md) which an [altitude](Altitudes.md) is [perpendicular](../../../../Curves/Straight%20Lines/Angle%20between%20Lines.md) to is known as the altitude's **base**.
>> 
>
>>[!NOTATION]-
>>
>>If the base of an altitude is $s$, we often denote the altitude itself with $h_s$.

>[!THEOREM] Theorem: Orthocenter
>
>The [extensions](../../../../Curves/Straight%20Lines/Line%20Segments.md) of the three [altitudes](Altitudes.md) in a given [triangle](../index.md) are [concurrent](../../../../Curves/Straight%20Lines/Concurrent%20Lines.md).

>>[!DEFINITION] Definition: Orthocenter

>>The [point](../../../../Euclidean%20Space/Points%20vs%20Vectors/index.md) of intersection of the [extensions](../../../../Curves/Straight%20Lines/Line%20Segments.md) of a [triangle](../index.md)'s [altitudes](Altitudes.md)  is known as the triangle's **orthocenter**.

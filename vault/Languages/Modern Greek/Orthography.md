# Diacritics

The acute accent `´` is used to mark stressed syllables in polysyllabic words and is placed on the vowel of said syllables. If the vowel is an uppercase letter, then the accent is placed up and to the left of it. If the letter is lowercase, then the accent is placed on top of it. In [digraphs](Orthography.md#Digraphs), the second letter takes the accent. 

>[!NOTE] Note: Multiple Accents
>
>Words with four or more syllables may have multiple stressed and thus accented syllables when followed by an unstressed word.
>

>[!EXAMPLE]- Example: Acute Accent for Stress
>
>είμαι /'i.me̞/
>
>αύριο /'av.ɾi.o/
>

The acute accent can also appear in monosyllabic words to distinguish between words which would otherwise be written the same.

>[!EXAMPLE]- Example: Acute Accent as Distinguisher
>
>πώς (how?, what?) <-> πως (that)
>
>ή (or) <-> η (the)
>

The diaeresis `¨` is used to indicate that two consecutive letters should *not* be treated as a [digraph](Orthography.md#Digraphs). It is placed on the second letter.

# Smooth Atlases

>[!DEFINITION] Definition: Smooth Atlas
>
>An [atlas](../../Geometry/Manifolds/Coordinate%20Systems/Atlases.md) is **smooth** iff all of its [charts](./index.md) are $C^{\infty}$-[compatible](./index.md).
>

# Smooth Structures

>[!DEFINITION] Definition: Smooth Structure
>
>A **smooth structure** on a [manifold](../../../Geometry/Manifolds/index.md) is a [maximal](../../Geometry/Manifolds/Coordinate%20Systems/Atlases.md) [smooth atlas](Smooth%20Manifolds.md).
>
>>[!NOTE]
>>
>>Smooth structures are also known as **differentiable structures**.

# Smooth Manifolds

>[!DEFINITION] Definition: Smooth Manifold
>
>A **smooth manifold** $(M, \mathcal{S})$ is a [manifold](../../../Geometry/Manifolds/index.md) $M$ equipped with a [smooth structure](Smooth%20Manifolds.md) $\mathcal{S}$.
>
>>[!NOTE]
>>
>>Although a smooth manifold technically has two components - a manifold $M$ and a smooth structure $\mathcal{S}$, - if $\mathcal{S}$ is understood from context we usually this technicality and just call $M$ a smooth manifold.

## Smooth Charts

>[!DEFINITION] Definition: Smooth Chart
>
>Let $(M, \mathcal{S})$ be a [smooth manifold](Smooth%20Manifolds.md).
>
>A **smooth chart** is any [chart](../../Geometry/Manifolds/Coordinate%20Systems/index.md) $(U, \phi)$ contained in the [smooth structure](Smooth%20Manifolds.md) $\mathcal{S}$.
>
>>[!DEFINITION] Definition: Smooth Coordinate System
>>
>>The [coordinate system](../../Geometry/Manifolds/Coordinate%20Systems/index.md) of a [smooth chart](Smooth%20Chart.md) is known as a **smooth coordinate system**.

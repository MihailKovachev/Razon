>The [real tangent function](Real%20Tangent%20Function.md) is [differentiable](../../../Differentiation/Differentiability%20of%20Real%20Functions.md) (everywhere it is defined) and its [derivative](../../../Differentiation/Differentiability%20of%20Real%20Functions.md) is the recirpocal of the square of the [real cosine function](../Real%20Cosine%20Function/Real%20Cosine%20Function.md):

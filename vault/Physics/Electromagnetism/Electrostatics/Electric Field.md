>[!DEFINITION] Definition: Electric Field
>
>The **electric field** $\boldsymbol{E}$ at a point $\boldsymbol{r}$ is a vector which characterises the [electrostatic force](Coulomb's%20Law.md) $\boldsymbol{F}$ which a [point charge](../Point%20Charge.md) $q$ would experience if it were placed there:

>$$\boldsymbol{F} = q\boldsymbol{E}$$

>>[!NOTE] Note: Charge Sign and Force Direction
>>
>>If $q$ is positive, then the [electrostatic force](Coulomb's%20Law.md) it experiences is in the same direction as the electric field.
>>
>>If $q$ is negative, then the [electrostatic force](Coulomb's%20Law.md) it experiences is in the opposite direction to the direction of the electric field.

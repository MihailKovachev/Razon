>A **real sequence** is a [sequence](../../Functions/Sequences/Sequence.md) of [real numbers](../../../../Algebra/Fields/Real%20Numbers/The%20Field%20of%20the%20Real%20Numbers.md).

>>Although, not strictly necessary, we usually assume that [real sequences](Real%20Sequence.md) have $\mathbb{N}$ or $\mathbb{N}_0$ as their [domain](../../Functions/Domain%20of%20a%20Function.md).

>[!DEFINITION] Definition: Differentiable Curve
>
>A **differentiable curve** is a [curve](Curve.md) which has a [differentiable parameterisation](../../../Analysis/Real%20Analysis/Multivariate%20Real%20Analysis/Parametric%20Curves/Differentiation/Differentiability%20of%20Parametric%20Curves.md).

>>[!WARNING]

>>Not all parameterisations of a differentiable curve are differentiable. However, when one speaks about a parameterisation of a differentiable curve, they usually mean a differentiable parameterisation.

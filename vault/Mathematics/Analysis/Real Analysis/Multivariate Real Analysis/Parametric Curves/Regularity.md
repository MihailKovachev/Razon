>[!DEFINITION] Definition: Regular Parametric Curve
>
>A [parametric curve](Parametric%20Curve.md) $\gamma: I \subseteq \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}^n$ is **regular** iff it is [differentiable](Differentiation/Differentiability%20of%20Parametric%20Curves.md) and its [derivative](Differentiation/Differentiability%20of%20Parametric%20Curves.md) is always nonzero.

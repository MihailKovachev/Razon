>>
>>The **dimension** of a [manifold](Manifold.md) is the [dimension](../../Algebra/Linear%20Algebra/Vector%20Spaces/Bases/Dimension.md) of the [Euclidean space](../Euclidean%20Geometry/Euclidean%20Space/Euclidean%20Space.md) which it is [locally homeomorphic](../../Topology/Continuity/Homeomorphisms/Locally%20Homeomorphic%20Spaces.md) to.

>>>[!NOTATION]-
>>>
>>> The dimension of a manifold is such a fundamental property that we often denote it as a superscript on the manifold's name. If the manifold is $M$ and its dimension is $n$, we write $M^n$ and call $M$ an $n$-manifold or an $n$-dimensional manifold.

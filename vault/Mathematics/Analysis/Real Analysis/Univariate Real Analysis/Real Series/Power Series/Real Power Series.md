>[!DEFINITION] Definition: Real Power Series
>
>A **real power series** is an [expression](../../../../../Logic/Formal%20Languages/Expression.md) of the form
>
>$$\sum_{n=0}^\infty c_n (x-a)^n,$$
>
>where $c_0, c_1, \cdots \in \mathbb{R}$ are called the **coefficients** of the power series and the number $a \in \mathbb{R}$ is called its **expansion point**.
>
>>[!INTUITION]-
>>
>>By plugging in a concrete value $x^\ast \in \mathbb{R}$ for $x$ one obtains the [infinite series](../Infinite%20Series.md)
>>
>>$$\sum_{n=0}^\infty c_n (x^\ast - a)^n$$
>>
>>In this way, a real power series can be thought of as a way to generate a specific type of infinite series - each value for $x^\ast$ results in a different series.

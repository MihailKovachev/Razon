>The [vector space](../../../Algebra/Linear%20Algebra/Matrices/Row%20and%20Column%20Vectors/Real%20Vectors/Structure%20of%20the%20Real%20Vector%20Space.md) $\mathbb{R}^n$ equipped with its [Euclidean topology](Euclidean%20Space/Euclidean%20Topology.md) is known as the $n$-dimensional **Euclidean space**.

>>When it is clear from context what $n$ is, or when $n$ is irrelevant, we usually drop "$n$-dimensional" and "geometric" and talk simply about "space".

>>[!THEOREM] Theorem: Euclidean Space is a Manifold
>>
>>The [Euclidean space](Euclidean%20Space.md) $\mathbb{R}^n$ is an $n$-[dimensional](../../Manifolds/Dimension%20of%20a%20Manifold.md) [manifold](../../Manifolds/Manifold.md).

>>>[!PROOF]-

>>>The [function](../../../Analysis/Real%20Analysis/Multivariate%20Real%20Analysis/Real%20Vector%20Functions/Real%20Vector%20Function.md) $\operatorname{id}:\mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}^n$ which maps every [vector](../../../Algebra/Linear%20Algebra/Matrices/Row%20and%20Column%20Vectors/Real%20Vectors/Real%20Vector.md) $\vec{v}$ to itself, i.e. $\operatorname{id}(\vec{v}) = \vec{v}$, is a [homeomorphism](../../../Topology/Continuity/Homeomorphisms/Homeomorphism.md) (and therefore a [local homeomorphism](../../../Topology/Continuity/Homeomorphisms/Local%20Homeomorphism.md) from $\mathbb{R}^n$ to $\mathbb{R}^n$.

# The Euclidean Topology

>[!DEFINITION] Definition: The Euclidean Topology
>
>The **Euclidean topology** on the [real vector space](../../../Algebra/Linear%20Algebra/Matrices/Row%20and%20Column%20Vectors/Real%20Vectors/Structure%20of%20the%20Real%20Vector%20Space.md) $\mathbb{R}^n$ is the [metric topology](../../../Topology/Metric%20Spaces/index.md) induced on it by the [Euclidean metric](../../Algebra/Linear%20Algebra/Vector%20Spaces/Inner%20Product%20Spaces/Euclidean%20Metric.md).
>
>The [vector space](../../../Algebra/Linear%20Algebra/Matrices/Row%20and%20Column%20Vectors/Real%20Vectors/Structure%20of%20the%20Real%20Vector%20Space.md) $\mathbb{R}^n$ equipped with its [Euclidean topology](The%20Topology%20of%20Euclidean%20Space.md) is known as the $n$-dimensional **Euclidean space**.

>[!THEOREM] Theorem: Euclidean Space is a Smooth Manifold
>
>The [atlas](../../Geometry/Manifolds/Coordinate%20Systems/Atlases.md) whose only [chart](../../Geometry/Manifolds/Coordinate%20Systems/index.md) is $(\mathbb{R}^n, \operatorname{id})$, where $\operatorname{id}$ is the [identity function](../../../Analysis/Functions/Identity%20Function.md) on the [Euclidean space](The%20Topology%20of%20Euclidean%20Space.md) $\mathbb{R}^n$, is a [smooth structure](../../../Analysis/Analysis%20on%20Manifolds/Smooth%20Manifolds.md) on $\mathbb{R}^n$ and naturally makes it a [smooth manifold](../../../Analysis/Analysis%20on%20Manifolds/Smooth%20Manifolds.md).

# Open Sets

>[!INTUITION] Intuition: Open Balls in Euclidean Space
>
>Let $p \in \mathbb{R}^n$ be an element of the [Euclidean space](The%20Topology%20of%20Euclidean%20Space.md) $\mathbb{R}^n$.
>
>An [open ball](../../../Topology/Metric%20Spaces/index.md) $B_r(p)$ of radius $r$ around $p$ contains all $x \in \mathbb{R}^n$ whose distance from $p$ is less than $r$. It is essentially an $n$-dimensional sphere which is centred at $p$ and has radius $r$.

>[!TIP] Tip: Open Sets in Euclidean Space
>
>The [open subsets](../../Topology/Topological%20Spaces.md) of the [Euclidean space](The%20Topology%20of%20Euclidean%20Space.md) $\mathbb{R}^n$ are precisely the following:
>- All [open balls](The%20Topology%20of%20Euclidean%20Space.md);
>- All [unions](../../../Set%20Theory/Collections/Operations%20with%20Collections.md) of arbitrary [collections](../../Set%20Theory/Collections/Collections.md) of [open balls](The%20Topology%20of%20Euclidean%20Space.md);
>- All [intersections](../../../Set%20Theory/Collections/Operations%20with%20Collections.md) of finite [collections](../../Set%20Theory/Collections/Collections.md) of [open balls](The%20Topology%20of%20Euclidean%20Space.md).

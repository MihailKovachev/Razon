# Geometric Shapes

>[!DEFINITION] Definition: Geometric Figure
>
>A **geometric figure** in the [Euclidean space](../../Analysis/Real%20Analysis/The%20Topology%20of%20Euclidean%20Space.md) $\mathbb{R}^n$ is any [subset](../../Set%20Theory/Sets.md) $G \subset \mathbb{R}^n$.

# Similarity

>[!DEFINITION] Definition: Similarity
>
>Two [geometric shapes](Geometric%20Shapes.md) $G_1$ and $G_2$ are **similar** iff there exists a transformation $f$ which is a combination of a translation and a scaling such that

# Congruence

>[!DEFINITION] Definition: Congruence
>
>Two [geometric shapes](Geometric%20Shapes.md) $G_1$ and $G_2$ are **congruent** if there exists an [isometry](../../Topology/Metric%20Spaces/Isometry.md) which maps $G_1$ onto $G_2$.

>Let $M$ be a [set](../../Set%20Theory/Set.md).

>A **metric** on $M$ is a [real-valued function](../../Analysis/Real%20Analysis/Real-Valued%20Function.md) which has the following properties for all $x, y, z \in M$:
>
>- Identity of indiscernibles: $d(x, y) \ge 0$ with $d(x, y) = 0 \iff x = y$
>- Symmetry: $d(x,y) = d(y,x)$
>- Triangle inequality: $d(x,z) \le d(x,y) + d(y,z)$

>[!DEFINITION] Definition: Even Function

>A [real function](../Functions%20of%20the%20Real%20Numbers.md) $f: \mathcal{D} \subseteq \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ is **even** iff

>$$
>f(-x) = f(x) \qquad \forall x \in \mathcal{D}

>[!DEFINITION] Definition: Odd Function
>
>A [real function](../Functions%20of%20the%20Real%20Numbers.md) $f: \mathcal{D} \subseteq \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ is **odd** if

## Properties

>
>If an [odd function](Parity.md) is [differentiable](Differentiability.md), then its [derivative](Differentiability.md) is an [even function](Parity.md).
>
>If an [even function](Parity.md) is [differentiable](Differentiability.md), then its [derivative](Differentiability.md) is an [odd function](Parity.md).

>A **solution** of a [system of linear equations](System%20of%20Linear%20Equations.md) with $n$ unknowns is any $n$-[tuple](../../../Set%20Theory/Tuples.md) $(l_1, \cdots, l_n)$ such that substituting $l_k$ for the $k$-th unknown variable results in all equations of the system being satisfied.

>>The **solution space** of a [system of linear equations](System%20of%20Linear%20Equations.md) is the [set](../../../Set%20Theory/Sets.md) of all [tuples](../../../Set%20Theory/Tuples.md) which are [solutions](Solvability%20of%20a%20System%20of%20Linear%20Equations.md) of the system.

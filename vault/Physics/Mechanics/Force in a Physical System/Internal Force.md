>We say that a [force](Force.md) acting on an object in a [physical system](../../Physical%20Systems/Physical%20System.md) is **internal** if its [reaction force](../Classical%20Mechanics/Newtonian%20Formalism/Newton's%20Laws%20of%20Translational%20Motion.md#^thirdlaw) acts on another object in the [physical system](../../Physical%20Systems/Physical%20System.md).

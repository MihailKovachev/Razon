>[!THEOREM] Theorem: Subspaces of Manifolds
>
>Let $(S, \tau_S)$ be a [subspace](../../Topology/Subspaces/Topological%20Subspace.md) of an $n$-[dimensional](Dimension%20of%20a%20Manifold.md) [manifold](Manifold.md).
>
>If $S$ is [open](../../Topology/Topological%20Spaces/Open%20Subset.md), then $(S, \tau_S)$ is also an $n$-[dimensional](Dimension%20of%20a%20Manifold.md) [manifold](Manifold.md).

>[!THEOREM]- The Theorem of Three Perpendiculars
>
>Let $a$ be a [straight line](Straight%20Lines%20in%203D.md) which intersects the [plane](../Surfaces/Planes.md) $\alpha$ and let $b$ be a [straight line](Straight%20Lines%20in%203D.md) which lies in $\alpha$.
>
>Then $a$ and $b$ are [perpendicular](Straight%20Lines%20in%203D.md) if and only if the [projection](TODO) of $a$ onto $\alpha$ is [perpendicular](Straight%20Lines%20in%203D.md) to $b$.

>[!DEFINITION] Definition: Smoothness of Parametric Surfaces
>
>Let $s: \mathcal{D} \subseteq \mathbb{R}^2 \to \mathbb{R}^3$ be a [parametric surface](Parametric%20Surface.md).
>
>We say that $s$ is **smooth at** $\mathbf{a}$ iff it is [differentiable](../Real%20Vector%20Functions/Differentiation/Differentiability%20of%20Real%20Vector%20Functions.md) there and its [normal vector](Surface%20Normal%20Vector.md) at $\mathbf{a}$ is nonzero.
>
>If $s$ is smooth at every $\mathbf{x}$ in some $S \subseteq \mathbb{R}^2$, then we say that $s$ is **smooth on** $S$. If $S = \mathcal{D}$, then we just say that $s$ is **smooth**.

# Average Velocity

>[!DEFINITION] Definition: Average Velocity
>
>The **average velocity** of a [point mass](../../Physical%20Systems/Point%20Masses/Point%20Mass.md) during a time interval $\Delta t$ is the ratio of its [displacement](Displacement.md) during $\Delta t$ over the length of the interval:
>
>$$\boldsymbol{v}_{\text{avg}} \overset{\text{def}}{=} \frac{\Delta \boldsymbol{r}}{\Delta t}$$

# Instantaneous Velocity

>[!DEFINITION] Definition: Instantaneous Velocity
>
>The **instantaneous velocity** of a [point mass](../../Physical%20Systems/Point%20Masses/Point%20Mass.md) at a moment $t_0$ is its average velocity within an infinitely small time interval after $t_0$:
>
>$$\boldsymbol{v}(t_0)\overset{\text{def}}{=} \lim_{\Delta t\to 0} \boldsymbol{v}_{\text{avg}} = \lim_{\Delta t\to 0} \frac{\boldsymbol{r}(t_0+\Delta t)-\boldsymbol{r}(t_0)}{\Delta t} = \frac{\mathrm{d}\boldsymbol{r}}{\mathrm{d}t}(t_0) = \dot{\boldsymbol{r}}(t_0)$$

>>The instantaneous velocity is just the temporal derivative of the [position](Position.md).

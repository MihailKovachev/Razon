# Introduction

Classical mechanics is the oldest and most commonly encountered branch of [physics](../index.md). It studies the motion of every-day objects and describes the majority of phenomena which we observe. 

# Assumptions of Classical Mechanics

As with any physics model, classical mechanics is a simplification of the real world which makes certain assumptions in order to function. Whilst we have no way of deriving these assumptions, experimental observations indicate that they are correct or at least are good enough approximations for correctly describing most situations.

## Space and Time

Classical mechanics models [space and time](../Space%20and%20Time.md) as a [topological space](../../Mathematics/Topology/Topological%20Spaces/index.md) which is [homeomorphic](../../Mathematics/Topology/Continuity/Homeomorphisms/Homeomorphic%20Spaces.md) to the [Euclidean Space](../../Mathematics/Analysis/Real%20Analysis/The%20Topology%20of%20Euclidean%20Space.md) $\mathbb{R}^4$ and which has certain properties. This means that one always needs four numbers to describe the location of an object. These numbers are known as the **coordinates** of the object and there are two kinds of them. Three of the numbers are **spatial coordinates** and one number is a **temporal coordinate**.

## Symmetries

There are also certain **symmetries** which the world appears to exhibit.

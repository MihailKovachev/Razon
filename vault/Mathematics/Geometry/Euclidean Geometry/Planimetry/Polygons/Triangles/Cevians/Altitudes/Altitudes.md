>[!DEFINITION] Definition: Altitude
>
>An **altitude** in a [triangle](../../Triangle.md) is a [line segment](../../../../../Curves/Line%20Segments/Line%20Segment.md) $h$ with the following properties:
>- The endpoints of $h$ are a [vertex](../../../Polygon.md) $V$ of the triangle and a [point](../../../../../Points%20and%20Vectors/Points%20vs%20Vectors.md) on the [extension](../../../../../Curves/Line%20Segments/Extension%20of%20a%20Line%20Segment.md) of the [side](../../../Polygon.md) $s$ opposite to $V$.
>- The segment $h$ is [perpendicular](../../../../../Curves/Lines/Perpendicular%20Lines.md) to the extension of $s$.
>
>>[!DEFINITION] Definition: Base
>>
>>The [side](../../../Polygon.md) which an [altitude](Altitudes.md) is [perpendicular](../../../../../Curves/Lines/Perpendicular%20Lines.md) to is known as the altitude's **base**.
>> 
>
>>[!NOTATION]-
>>
>>If the base of an altitude is $s$, we often denote the altitude itself with $h_s$.

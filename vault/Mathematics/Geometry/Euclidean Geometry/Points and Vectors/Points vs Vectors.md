>[!INTUITION] Intuition: Points vs Vectors
>
>[Points](Points%20in%20Geometry.md) and [vectors](Vectors%20in%20Geometry.md) in [Euclidean geometry](../Euclidean%20Geometry.md) are the same thing - they are [real column vectors](../../../Algebra/Linear%20Algebra/Matrices/Row%20and%20Column%20Vectors/Real%20Vectors/Real%20Vector.md) in the [Euclidean space](../Euclidean%20Space.md) $\mathbb{R}^n$. We simply use different terminology and / or notation when we want to emphasise different aspects of those real column vectors.

>- Point terminology is used when we are more interested in the location which the real column vector represents, i.e. we want to focus our attention on its components.
>- Vector terminology is used when we are more interested in the vectors's length

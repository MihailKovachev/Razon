>The **thermal efficiency** of a [heat engine](Heat%20Engine.md) is the ratio of the [work](../../Mechanics/Classical%20Mechanics/Newtonian%20Formalism/Energy/Work.md) $W$ done by the engine and the [heat](../../Heat.md) $Q_\text{H}$ which it absorbs:

>>The thermal efficiency can be equivalently expressed via the heat $Q_\text{H}$ that the engine absorbs and the heat $Q_\text{C}$ which it releases:

>Suppose we have two [parameterisations](../../Physical%20Systems/Parameter.md) $P_1$ and $P_2$ of a [physical system](../../Physical%20Systems/Physical%20System.md) with $n_1$ and $n_2$ [parameters](../../Physical%20Systems/Parameter.md), respectively.
>
>If $n_1 \lt n_2$ and the values of all [parameters](../../Physical%20Systems/Parameter.md) in $P_2$ can be determined if we know the values of all [parameters](../../Physical%20Systems/Parameter.md) in $P_1$, then any [physical state](../../Physical%20Systems/Physical%20State.md) from $P_1$ is called a **microstate** and any [physical state](../../Physical%20Systems/Physical%20State.md) from $P_2$ is called a **macrostate**.

# Curves

>[!DEFINITION] Definition: Curve
>
>A **curve** $\mathcal{C}$ in $\mathbb{R}^n$ is a [geometric figure](../Geometric%20Figure.md) which is the [image](../../../Analysis/Functions/Functions.md) of a nonconstant [parametric curve](../../../Analysis/Real%20Analysis/Real%20Vector%20Functions/Parametric%20Curves/Parametric%20Curve.md) $\gamma$.

>>>[!NOTE]
>>>
>>>A curve may have multiple parametrizations.

>>The curve and its parametrizations are both often referred to as "curve".

## Parametrizations

>[!DEFINITION] Definition: Curve Parametrization
>
>A **parametrization** of a [curve](Curves.md#Curves) $\mathcal{C}$ in $\mathbb{R}^n$ is a [continuous](../../../Analysis/Real%20Analysis/Real%20Vector%20Functions/Continuity%20of%20Real%20Vector%20Functions.md) [function](../../../Analysis/Real%20Analysis/Real%20Vector%20Functions/Real%20Vector%20Function.md) $\gamma: I \subseteq \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}^n$ on an [interval](../../../Analysis/Real%20Analysis/The%20Topology%20of%20Euclidean%20Space.md) $I$ whose [image](../../../Analysis/Functions/Functions.md) is $\mathcal{C}$.

The same [curve](Curves.md#Curves) can have many different [parametrizations](Curves.md#Parametrizations).

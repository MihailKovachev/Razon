>[!DEFINITION] Definition: Kinetic-Molecular Model of an Ideal Gas
>
>The **kinetic-molecular model of an ideal gas** is an idealisation of gases which makes the following assumptions:
>
>>[!AXIOM] Axiom: Assumptions of the Kinetic-Molecular Model
>>
>>1. The gas is comprised of a very large number of identical particles, each with mass $m$, which are enclosed in a container with volume $V$.
>>2. These particles are very small compared to the size of the container and to the average distance between particles and therefore behave as [point masses](../../../Physical%20Systems/Point%20Masses/Point%20Mass.md).
>>3. These particles are moving constantly and occasionally [colliding elastically](../../Mechanics/Classical%20Mechanics/Newtonian%20Formalism/Collisions/Elastic%20Collision.md) with the walls of the container.
>>4. The container walls are rigid, infinitely massive and thus unable to move.

>An [ideal gas](Kinetic-Molecular%20Model%20of%20an%20Ideal%20Gas.md) in thermodynamics is [parameterized](../../../Physical%20Systems/Parameter.md) in two different ways:
>- Microscopically, through the [positions](../../../Kinematics/Translation/Position.md) and [momenta](../../Mechanics/Classical%20Mechanics/Momentum/Momentum.md) of all of its particles - the [physical state](../../../Physical%20Systems/Physical%20State.md) of the gas with respect to this microscopic [parameterization](../../../Physical%20Systems/Parameter.md) is its [microstate](../../../Physical%20Systems/Microstate%20and%20Macrostate.md).
>- Macroscopically, through its [pressure](../../Mechanics/Classical%20Mechanics/Fluid%20Mechanics/Pressure%20in%20a%20fluid.md) $p$, [temperature](../../Temperature.md) $T$, volume $V$ and number of particles $N$ - the [physical state](../../../Physical%20Systems/Physical%20State.md) of the gas with respect to this macroscopic [parameterisation](../../../Physical%20Systems/Parameter.md) is its [macrostate](../../../Physical%20Systems/Microstate%20and%20Macrostate.md).

>[!THEOREM] Theorem: Integrability of the Absolute Value
>
>If $f$ is [Riemann-integrable](Riemann-Integrability.md) on a closed interval $[a;b]$, then so is its absolute value $|f|$ with the following inequality:
>
>$$\left|\int_a^b f(x) \mathop{\mathrm{d}x} \right| \le \int_a^b |f(x)| \mathop{\mathrm{d}x}$$

# Surfaces

>[!DEFINITION] Definition: Surface
>
>A **surface** in $\mathbb{R}^n$ is a [subset](../../../Set%20Theory/Sets.md) $\mathcal{S} \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$ for which there exists a [continuous](../../../Analysis/Real%20Analysis/Real%20Vector%20Functions/Continuity%20of%20Real%20Vector%20Functions.md) [function](../../../Analysis/Real%20Analysis/Real%20Vector%20Functions/Real%20Vector%20Function.md) $\varphi: \mathcal{D} \subseteq \mathbb{R}^2 \to \mathbb{R}^n$ on a [connected set](../../../Analysis/Real%20Analysis/The%20Topology%20of%20Euclidean%20Space.md#Connectedness) $\mathcal{D}$ whose [image](../../../Analysis/Functions/Functions.md) is $\mathcal{S}$ and which is [injective](../../../Analysis/Functions/Types%20of%20Functions/Injection.md) on $\mathcal{D}$ except possibly at the [boundary](../../../Topology/Interior,%20Boundary,%20Exterior/Boundary.md) $\partial \mathcal{D}$.

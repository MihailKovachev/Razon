# Introduction

In principle, [Coulomb's law](Coulomb's%20Law.md) can be used together with the [superposition principle](../../Mechanics/Force.md) to describe the [electrostatic forces](Coulomb's%20Law.md) between many [point charges](../Electric%20Charge.md). However, this process becomes very complicated and tedious as the number of charges increases and is outright impossible to use when dealing with [continuous charge distributions](../Electric%20Charge.md).

# The Model of the Electric Field

It turns out that we can paraphrase [Coulomb's law](Coulomb's%20Law.md) in a way to make this simpler. We imagine that space is filled with a [vector field](../../../Mathematics/Analysis/Real%20Analysis/Real%20Vector%20Functions/Vector%20Fields/Real%20Vector%20Field.md), i.e. that each point $\mathbf{r}$ is assigned a [vector](../../../Mathematics/Algebra/Linear%20Algebra/Matrices/Row%20and%20Column%20Vectors/Real%20Vectors/Real%20Vector.md) $\mathbf{E}(\mathbf{r})$. This vector depends on the spatial configuration of all [electric charges](../Electric%20Charge.md) and can be used to calculate the total [electrostatic force](Coulomb's%20Law.md) which would act on a [point charge](../Electric%20Charge.md) if it were placed at rest at $\mathbf{r}$.

[Coulomb's law](Coulomb's%20Law.md) and the concept of the electric field are equivalent - we can use the former to derive the latter and the latter to derive the former. They are two equivalent models of the same thing. However, the electric field is generally a lot easier to work with, especially when multiple charges are involved. More importantly, it can even be used to calculate the total electromagnetic force on a *moving* charge.

# Sources of Electric Fields

The [electric field](The%20Electric%20Field.md) can be generated by [electric charges](../Electric%20Charge.md) or by a time-varying [magnetic field](../Magnetostatics/Magnetic%20Field.md).

>>If $Q$ is positive, then the $\mathbf{E}_Q(\mathbf{r})$ always points radially away from $Q$. Conversely, if $Q$ is negative, then $\mathbf{E}_Q(\mathbf{r})$ towards $Q$.

So defined, the electric field yields the same results as [Coulomb's law](Coulomb's%20Law.md).

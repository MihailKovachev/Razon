>[!THEOREM] Theorem: Continuity of Restrictions
>
>Let $(X, \tau_X)$ and $(Y, \tau_Y)$ be [topological spaces](../Topological%20Spaces/Topological%20Space.md).
>
>If $f: X \to Y$ is [continuous](Continuity.md) and $S$ is an [open subset](../Topological%20Spaces/Open%20Subset.md) of $X$, then the [restriction](../../Analysis/Functions/Restriction.md) $f\big|_S$ is also [continuous](Continuity.md).

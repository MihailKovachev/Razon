# Hyperbola

>[!DEFINITION] Definition: Hyperbola
>
>A **hyperbola** is a [geometric shape](../../Geometric%20Shapes.md) $H$ for which there exist two points $F_1, F_2$ such that for each point $P \in H$, the absolute value of the difference in the distances between $P$ and $F_1$ and $P$ and $F_2$ is constant.

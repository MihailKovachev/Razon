>A **local homeomorphism** is a [function](../../../Analysis/Functions/index.md) $f: X \to Y$ such that every $x \in X$ has an [open](../../Topological%20Spaces/Open%20Subset.md) [neighbourhood](../../Topological%20Spaces/Neighbourhoods.md) $O$ whose [image](../../../Analysis/Functions/index.md) $f(O)$ is [open](../../Topological%20Spaces/Open%20Subset.md) and for which the [restriction](../../../Analysis/Functions/Restriction.md) $f\big|_O$ is a [homeomorphism](Homeomorphism.md) between the [subspaces](../../Subspaces/Topological%20Subspace.md) $O$ and $f(O)$.

>[!DEFINITION] Definition: Relation
>
>A **relation** $R \subseteq A \times B$ between two [sets](../Sets.md) $A$ and $B$ is any [subset](../Sets.md) of the [Cartesian product](../Set%20Operations.md#cartesian%20product) $A\times B$.
>
>>[!NOTATION]-
>>
>>For any $a \in A$ and any $b \in B$, if $(a;b) \in R$, then we write
>>
>>$$
>>a\,\, R\,\, b
>>$$
>>
>
>>[!INTUITION]-
>>
>>The statement $a \,\, R\,\, b$ translates to "there is a relationship between $a$ and $b$ which is expressed by $R$".
>>
>
>>[!EXAMPLE]-
>>
>>Let $R \subseteq \mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N}$ be the relation
>>
>>$$
>>R = \{(a;b)\mid a,b \in \mathbb{N} \text{ and } b \text{ is a divisor of a} \}
>>$$
>>
>>For any $x,y \in \mathbb{N}$, the statement $x\,\, R\,\, y$ means that $(x,y) \in R$ which in this case translates to "$y$ is a divisor of $b$".

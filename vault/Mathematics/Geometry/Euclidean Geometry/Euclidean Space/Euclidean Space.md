>[!DEFINITION] Definition: Euclidean Space

>The [vector space](../../../Algebra/Linear%20Algebra/Matrices/Row%20and%20Column%20Vectors/Real%20Vectors/Structure%20of%20the%20Real%20Vector%20Space.md) $\mathbb{R}^n$ equipped with its [Euclidean topology](Euclidean%20Space/Euclidean%20Topology.md) is known as the $n$-dimensional **Euclidean space**.

>>[!NOTE]

>>When it is clear from context what $n$ is, or when $n$ is irrelevant, we usually drop "$n$-dimensional" and "geometric" and talk simply about "space".

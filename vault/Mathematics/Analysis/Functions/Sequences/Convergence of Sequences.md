>[!DEFINITION] Definition: Convergence of Sequences
>
>Let $(X, \tau)$ be a [topological space](../../../Topology/Topological%20Spaces/index.md) and let $(x_n)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ be a [sequence](Sequences.md) of points in $X$.
>
>We say that $(x_n)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ is **convergent** if there exists some $x \in X$ iff for each [neighbourhood](../../../Topology/Topological%20Spaces/Neighborhoods.md) $N(x)$ there exists some $N_0 \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $x_n \in N(x)$ for all $n \ge N_0$.
>
>We also say that $(x_n)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ **converges to** $x$.

>[!DEFINITION] Definition: Polynomial
>
>A **polynomial** over a [commutative ring](../Commutative%20Ring.md) $R$ in the [variables](TODO) $x_1, \cdots, x_n$ is an [expression](../../../../Logic/Formal%20Languages/Expression.md) which can be written as a finite sum of [monomials](Monomials/Monomial.md) in $x_1, \cdots, x_n$.

>>[!NOTATION]-
>>
>>We usually use capital Latin letters such as $P$ and $Q$ to denote polynomials. If we want to be explicit about the variables, we write $P(x_1, \cdots, x_n)$.

>>[!DEFINITION] Definition: Leading Coefficient

>>The **leading coefficient** of a [polynomial](polynomial.md) is the [coefficient](Monomials/Monomial.md) of its highest-[degree](Monomials/Degree%20of%20a%20Monomial.md) [monomial](Monomials/Monomial.md).

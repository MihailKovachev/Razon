>[!THEOREM] Theorem: Differentiability implies Continuity
>
>Let $f: \mathcal{D} \to \mathbb{R}^n$ be a [real vector function](../../Functions%20of%20the%20Real%20Numbers.md) on an [open subset](../../The%20Topology%20of%20Euclidean%20Space.md) $\mathcal{D} \subseteq \mathbb{R}^m$.
>
>If $f$ is [differentiable](Differentiability%20of%20Real%20Vector%20Functions.md) at $\mathbf{x}_0 \in \mathcal{D}$, then $f$ is also [continuous](../Continuity%20of%20Real%20Vector%20Functions.md) there.

>>We consider an interaction between any two objects $A$ and $B$ in the physical system. According to [Newton's third law of motion](../Newtonian%20Formalism/Newton's%20Laws%20of%20Translational%20Motion.md#^thirdlaw), this interaction manifests as two [forces](../../Force.md) $\boldsymbol{F}_{A \text{ on } B}$ and $\boldsymbol{F}_{B \text{ on } A}$ with

>>According to [Newton's second law of motion](../Newtonian%20Formalism/Newton's%20Laws%20of%20Translational%20Motion.md#^secondlaw) the [force](../../Force.md) $\boldsymbol{F}_{A \text{ on } B}$ is equal to the change $\frac{\mathrm{d}\boldsymbol{p}_B}{\mathrm{d}t}$ in the [momentum](Momentum.md) of $B$ and the [force](../../Force.md) $\boldsymbol{F}_{B \text{ on } A}$ is equal to the change $\frac{\mathrm{d}\boldsymbol{p}_A}{\mathrm{d}t}$ in the [momentum](Momentum.md) of $A$. This means that

>>\frac{\mathrm{d}\boldsymbol{p}_A}{\mathrm{d}t} = -\frac{\mathrm{d}\boldsymbol{p}_B}{\mathrm{d}t}

>>
>>$$
>>\frac{\mathrm{d}\boldsymbol{p}_A}{\mathrm{d}t} + \frac{\mathrm{d}\boldsymbol{p}_B}{\mathrm{d}t} = \boldsymbol{0}

>>Therefore, the change in the total [momentum](Momentum.md) of $A$ and $B$ is zero and is thus unaffected by [internal forces](../../Force%20in%20a%20Physical%20System/Internal%20Force.md). This is true for any pair of objects in the [physical system](../../../Physical%20Systems/Physical%20System.md) and so it must be true for the total [momentum](Momentum.md) of the entire system. This means that the total [momentum](Momentum.md) is only affected by [external forces](../../Force%20in%20a%20Physical%20System/External%20Force.md) and if there are no such forces, then it is not affected by anything and therefore remains unchanged.

>An **equivalence relation** on the [set](../Sets.md) $A$ is any [relation](./index.md) $R \subseteq A \times A$ which is [reflexive](Reflexivity.md), [transitive](Transitivity.md) and [symmetric](Symmetry.md).

>>[!INTUITION]-

>>The statement $x\sim y$ means that $x$ is equal to $y$ in the sense of $\sim$.

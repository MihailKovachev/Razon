>>[!INTUITION]-
>>
>>Defined in this way, mathematical events allow us to closely model real-world conditions. However, we need a way to translate between the mathematical formalism of events and their physical reality. Hence, we say that an event has **occurred** if the outcome of the experiment is an element of the event.

>>[!TIP]- Tip: Union of Events
>>
>>The [union](../Set%20Theory/Collections/Union%20of%20a%20Collection.md) of a [collection](../Set%20Theory/Collections/Collection.md) of [events](Event.md) is the event which occurs if and only if at least one of the events in the collection occurs.
>>

>>[!TIP]- Tip: Intersection of Events
>>
>>The [intersection](../Set%20Theory/Collections/Intersection%20of%20a%20Collection.md) of a [collection](../Set%20Theory/Collections/Collection.md) of [events](Event.md) is the event which occurs if and only if all of the events in the collection occur.
>>

>>[!TIP]- Tip: Complement of an Event
>>
>>The [complement](../Set%20Theory/Complement.md) of an event $E$ is the event which occurs if and only if $E$ does *not* occur.

>[!DEFINITION] Definition: Mutual Exclusiveness
>
>Two [events](Event.md) are **mutually exclusive** iff their [intersection](../Set%20Theory/Operations%20with%20Sets/Intersection.md) is the [empty set](../Set%20Theory/The%20Empty%20Set.md).

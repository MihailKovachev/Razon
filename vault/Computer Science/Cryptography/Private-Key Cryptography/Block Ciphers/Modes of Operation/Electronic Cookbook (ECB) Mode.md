# Introduction

The most naive mode of operation is called *Electronic Cookboook (ECB)* mode. It divides the message into blocks $\mu_1, \mu_2, ..., \mu_q$ with length $l_b$, according to whatever block cipher is used, and then separately encrypts each block with the block cipher's encryption algorithm and the same key $k$. The final ciphertext is produced by concatenating the ciphertexts of each block.

Decryption is just the opposite - it divides the ciphertext into blocks $\sigma_1, \sigma_2, ..., \sigma_q$ and decrypts each one separately. The original message is recovered by concatenating the decryptions of every ciphertext block.

# Security of ECB Mode

The ECB Mode is very simple so it comes as no surprise that it is not very secure.

In particular, it is *not* [CPA-secure](../../Security%20Definitions/Chosen%20Plaintext%20Attack%20(CPA).md), since it is entirely deterministic. Moreover, it is not even [semantically secure](../../Security%20Definitions/Ciphertext-Only%20Attack%20(COA)/Semantic%20Security.md) because if a block is repeated in the plaintext, then the corresponding ciphertext block will also be repeated in the ciphertext which reveals a lot of information about the underlying message.

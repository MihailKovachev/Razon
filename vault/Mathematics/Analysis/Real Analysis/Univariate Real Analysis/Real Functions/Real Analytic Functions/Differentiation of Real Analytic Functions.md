>Every [real analytic function](Real%20Analytic%20Function.md) $f(x) = \displaystyle \sum_{n=0}^\infty c_n (x-a)^n$ on an [open interval](../../../../../Set%20Theory/Ordering/Intervals.md) $D \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ is [differentiable](../../Differentiation/Differentiability%20of%20Real%20Functions.md) on $D$ and its derivative $f'(x)$ is also a real analytic function given by

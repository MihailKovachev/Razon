# Introduction

All celestial bodies, except the Sun and the Moon, are so far away that simple observation of the sky cannot actually discern differences in the distance between the Earth and them. In fact, they all look like small, bright dots of light. However, we still need a way to map the sky and describe the positions of celestial bodies.

# The Celestial Sphere

To achieve this, we introduce the concept of the **celestial sphere**. 

>[!DEFINITION] Definition: The Celestial Sphere

>The **celestial sphere** is an imaginary sphere of arbitrary radius whose center is at the center of the Earth.

We imagine that all celestial bodies are positioned on the surface of this sphere and then use coordinates to describe their location, ignoring the distance between us and them. Obviously, the same celestial body will have a different location, depending on where on Earth you are. In fact, two observers might not even be able to see the same object.

## The Celestial Horizon

Due to its size, the Earth always obstructs about half of the celestial sphere, irrespective of what the location of an observer is. 

>[!DEFINITION] Definition: The Celestial Horizon

>The plane tangent to the Earth at the location of an observer intersects the celestial sphere in a great circle known as the **celestial horizon** of the observer.

The celestial horizon of an observer divides the celestial sphere into two hemispheres. The Earth obstructs the light coming from all celestial bodies in the lower hemisphere and so these objects cannot be seen by the observer.

>[!NOTE]- Note: Astronomical Horizon vs True Horizon
>
>The aforementioned celestial horizon is also known as the observer's **astronomical horizon**. It is a simplification because it assumes that the observer has no size and is just a point on the surface of the Earth.
>
>In practice, however, all observers have a size. For example, your eyes are some 180 cm above Earth's surface. As height increases, so does the part of the lower hemisphere which an observer can see. The new plane below which all celestial bodies are obstructed by Earth and are thus invisible to the observer is called the **true horizon**.
>
>Usually, the observer's distance from the surface of the Earth is negligibly small and the astronomical horizon aligns more-or-less perfectly with the true horizon. Therefore, most of the time, we ignore the distinction between the two.

## Zenith and Nadir

Imagine the line joining Earth's center and an observer. This line is perpendicular to the observer's celestial horizon and intersects the celestial sphere in two points.

## Drawing Celestial Spheres

No single way to draw the celestial sphere for a given observer is more correct than another. However, there are certain conventions which have been established so as to ease the deciphering of the information on diagrams with celestial spheres.

Most commonly, the celestial sphere is drawn such that the zenith of the observer is right at the top and their nadir is right at the bottom.

>[!DEFINITION] Definition: Tangent

>A [straight line](../../../Curves/Straight%20Lines/index.md) and a [circle](./index.md) are **tangent** iff they lie in the same [plane](../../../Surfaces/Planes.md) and their [intersection](../../../../../Set%20Theory/Set%20Operations.md) is a single [point](../../../Euclidean%20Space/Points%20vs%20Vectors/index.md).

>A [line segment](../../../Curves/Straight%20Lines/Line%20Segments.md) $s$ and a [circle](./index.md) $k$ are **tangent** iff their [intersection](../../../../../Set%20Theory/Set%20Operations.md) is a single [point](../../../Euclidean%20Space/Points%20vs%20Vectors/index.md) and the [extension](../../../Curves/Straight%20Lines/Line%20Segments.md) of $s$ is tangent to $k$.

>[!THEOREM] Theorem: Internal Energy of an Ideal Gas
>
>The [internal energy](../../Internal%20Energy.md) $U$ of an [ideal gas](Kinetic-Molecular%20Model%20of%20an%20Ideal%20Gas.md) depends on the number $f$ of [degrees of freedom of a single gas particle](Degrees%20of%20Freedom%20of%20Gas%20Particles.md), the total number $N$ of particles and the [temperature](../../Temperature.md) $T$ of the gas and is given by the following equation, where $k_B$ is the [Boltzmann constant](../../Boltzmann%20Constant.md):

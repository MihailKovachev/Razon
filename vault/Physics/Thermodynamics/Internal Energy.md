>[!DEFINITION] Definition: Internal Energy

>The **internal energy** of a [physical system](../Physical%20Systems/Physical%20System.md) is the sum of the [kinetic energies](../Mechanics/Classical%20Mechanics/Newtonian%20Formalism/Energy/Kinetic%20Energy.md) of its components and their [potential energies](../Mechanics/Classical%20Mechanics/Newtonian%20Formalism/Energy/Potential%20Energy.md) due to [internal forces](../Mechanics/Force%20in%20a%20Physical%20System/Internal%20Force.md).

>[!DEFINITION] Definition: Global Coordinate System
>
>A [coordinate system](Coordinate%20System.md) on an $n$-[manifold](../Manifolds.md) $M$ is **global** iff its [domain](../../../Analysis/Functions/Domain%20of%20a%20Function.md) is the entirety of $M$.
>
>>[!INTUITION]-
>>
>>A global coordinate system extends to the entire manifold - each point $p \in M$ can be uniquely assigned $n$ coordinates.
>>
>
>>[!WARNING]
>>
>>Most manifolds do *not* admit global coordinate systems because this would require that they are [homeomorphic](../../../Topology/Continuity/Homeomorphisms/Homeomorphic%20Spaces.md) to $\mathbb{R}^n$.

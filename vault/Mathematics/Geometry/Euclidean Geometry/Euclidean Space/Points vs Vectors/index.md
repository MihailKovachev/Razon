>>[!INTUITION]-

>>In geometry, we tend to think of vectors as arrows which point from the origin to some location in space, i.e. we think of vectors as having a [length](Length%20of%20a%20Vector.md) and a direction. This way of thinking is especially useful in $3$ and $2$ dimensions, since it can be easily visualised.

>If $P$ and $Q$ are two [points](./index.md), then we use $\overrightarrow{PQ}$ to denote the [vector](../../../../Algebra/Linear%20Algebra/Matrices/Row%20and%20Column%20Vectors/Real%20Vectors/Real%20Vector.md) $Q - P$.

>[Poin[Points](./index.md)[vectors](./index.md) in [Euclidean geometry](../../index.md) are the same thing - they are [real column vectors](../../../../Algebra/Linear%20Algebra/Matrices/Row%20and%20Column%20Vectors/Real%20Vectors/Real%20Vector.md) in the [Euclidean space](../index.md) $\mathbb{R}^n$. We simply use different terminology and / or notation when we want to emphasise different aspects of those real column vectors.

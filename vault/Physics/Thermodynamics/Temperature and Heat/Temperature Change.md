>The change $\Delta T$ in the [temperature](Temperature.md) $T$ of a [physical system](../../Physical%20Systems/Physical%20System.md) depends on the [heat](Heat.md) $Q$ which flows into or out of it:
>- If [heat](Heat.md) flows *into* the [system](../../Physical%20Systems/Physical%20System.md) $(Q \gt 0)$, then its [temperature](Temperature.md) *increases* $(\Delta T \gt 0)$.
>- If [heat](Heat.md) flows *out* of the [system](../../Physical%20Systems/Physical%20System.md) $(Q \lt 0)$, then its [temperature](Temperature.md) *decreases* $(\Delta T \lt 0)$.
>
>When the [temperature](../Temperature.md) change is relatively small, the [heat](../Heat.md) required to achieve it is approximately proportional to it:
>- The [heat](../Heat.md) $Q$ can be expressed via the mass $m$ and the [specific heat capacity](Specific%20Heat%20Capacity.md) $c$ of the substance.

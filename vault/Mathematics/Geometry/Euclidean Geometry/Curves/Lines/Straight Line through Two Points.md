>[!THEOREM] Theorem: Straight Line through Two Points
>
>If $P_1$ and $P_2$ are two distinct [points](../../Points%20and%20Vectors/Points%20in%20Geometry.md) in $n$-dimensional [Euclidean space](../../Euclidean%20Space.md), then there exists one and only one [straight line](Straight%20Line.md) $l$ which contains both points, i.e. $P_1 \in l$ and $P_2 \in l$.

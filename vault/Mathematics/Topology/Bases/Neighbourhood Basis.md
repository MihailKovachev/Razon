>[!DEFINITION] Definition: Neighbourhood Basis
>
>Let $(X, \tau)$ be a [topological space](../Topological%20Spaces.md) and let $p \in X$.
>
>A [collection](../../Set%20Theory/Collections/Collections.md) $\mathcal{B}$ of [neighbourhoods](../Topological%20Spaces.md) of $p$ is a **neighbourhood basis** of $(X, \tau)$ at $p$ iff for each [](../Topological%20Spaces.md#^neighbourhood-of-a-point) $N(p)$, there exists some [neighbourhood](../Topological%20Spaces.md) $B(p) \in \mathcal{B}$ such that $B(p) \subseteq N(p)$.

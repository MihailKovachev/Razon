# Probability Theory

**Probability theory** is the branch of mathematics which studies randomness.

The mathematical framework for studying randomness and its properties is built upon the foundations of [set theory](../Set%20Theory/index.md). We usually frame this study in the terminology of [experiments](Experiment.md). When we perform an experiment, it has a particular outcome. We group all possible outcomes in the so-called [sample space](Sample%20Space.md). We then examine how often each outcome or a combination of outcomes (also known as an [event](Event.md)) appears in the sample space to determine [probabilities](Probability.md).

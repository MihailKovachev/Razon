>>Well-formed formulas can be thought of as expressions which are meaningful in the context of a given language. For example, the sentence "Yesterday, Harry went to the bar" is meaningful and can be considered a wff in English. In constrast, the sentence "Fall on the in chair sock" does not carry any meaning and is, therefore, *not* a wff in English.

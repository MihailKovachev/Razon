>[!DEFINITION] Definition: Momentum of a Point Mass
>
>The **momentum** of a [point mass](../../../Physical%20Systems/Point%20Masses/Point%20Mass.md) is a vector quantity which depends on the [velocity](../../../Kinematics/Translation/Velocity.md) $\boldsymbol{v}$ and the mass $m$ of the [point mass](../../../Physical%20Systems/Point%20Masses/Point%20Mass.md).

>[!THEOREM] Theorem: Momentum of a Physical System
>
>The total [momentum](Momentum.md) of a [physical system](../../../Physical%20Systems/Physical%20System.md) is the same as the [momentum](Momentum.md) of its [centre of mass](../../../Physical%20Systems/Point%20Masses/Centre%20of%20Mass.md):

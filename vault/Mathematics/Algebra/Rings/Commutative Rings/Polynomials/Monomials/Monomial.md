>>[!NOTATION]-
>>
>>If $p_i = 0$, then we do not write $x_i^0$ or $1$, we just do not write anything about $x_i$ at all.
>>
>>If $p_i = 1$, then we write simply $x_i$ instead of $x_i^1$. 
>>
>>We usually use capital Latin letters such as $M$ and $N$ to denote monomials. If we want to be explicit about the variables, we write $M(x_1, \cdots, x_n)$.

>>We call $a$ the **coefficient** of the monomial.

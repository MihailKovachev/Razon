>[!THEOREM] Theorem: Lines in a Plane
>
>For every two distinct [straight lines](../../../Curves/Lines/Straight%20Line.md) which lie in the same [plane](../../../Surfaces/Planes/Plane.md) there are two possibilities:
>
>- The lines intersect in a single [point](../../../Points%20and%20Vectors/Points%20in%20Geometry.md).
>- The lines do not intersect.

>[!THEOREM] Theorem: Subspaces of Manifolds

>Let $(S, \tau_S)$ be a [subspace](../../Topology/Subspaces/Topological%20Subspace.md) of an $n$-[manifold](Manifolds.md).
>
>If $S$ is [open](../../Topology/Topological%20Spaces/Open%20Subset.md), then $(S, \tau_S)$ is also an $n$-[manifold](Manifolds.md).

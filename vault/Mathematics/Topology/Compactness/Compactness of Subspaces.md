>A [subspace](../Subspaces/Topological%20Subspace.md) $(S, \tau_S)$ of a [topological space](../Topological%20Spaces/Topological%20Space.md) $(X, \tau_X)$ is [compact](Compactness.md) if and only if every [cover](Cover.md) of $S$ by [open subsets](../Topological%20Spaces/Open%20Subset.md) in $(X, \tau_X)$ contains a finite [subcollection](../../Set%20Theory/Collections/Subcollection.md) which is also a [cover](Cover.md) of $(S, \tau_S)$.

>>**Proof of (I):**

>>Suppose that $(S, \tau_S)$ is [compact](Compactness.md) and let $\mathcal{C}$ be a [cover](Cover.md) of $S$ consisting of [open subset](../Topological%20Spaces/Open%20Subset.md) of $(X, \tau_X)$.

>[!THEOREM] Theorem: Composition of Homeomorphisms
>
>Let $(X, \tau_X)$, $(Y, \tau_Y)$ and $(Z, \tau_Z)$ be [topological spaces](../../Topological%20Spaces/Topological%20Space.md).
>
>If $f: X \to Y$ and $g: Y \to Z$ are [homeomorphisms](Homeomorphism.md), then their [composition](../../../Analysis/Functions/Composition.md) $g \circ f: X \to Z$ is also a [homeomorphism](Homeomorphism.md).

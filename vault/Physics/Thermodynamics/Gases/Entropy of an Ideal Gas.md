>The **entropy** of an [ideal gas](Kinetic-Molecular%20Model%20of%20an%20Ideal%20Gas.md) is defined as the product of the [Boltzmann constant](Boltzmann%20Constant.md) $k_B$ and the natural logarithm of the [multiplicity](../../../Physical%20Systems/Multiplicity.md) $\Omega$ of its [macrostate](Kinetic-Molecular%20Model%20of%20an%20Ideal%20Gas.md).

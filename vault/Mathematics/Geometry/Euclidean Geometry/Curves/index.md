>[!DEFINITION] Definition: Curve

>A **curve** $\mathcal{C}$ in $\mathbb{R}^n$ is a [geometric figure](../Geometric%20Figure.md) which is the [image](../../../Analysis/Functions/index.md) of a nonconstant [parametric curve](../../../Analysis/Real%20Analysis/Real%20Vector%20Functions/Parametric%20Curves/Parametric%20Curve.md) $\gamma$.

>>The function $\gamma$ is called a **parametrization** of $\mathcal{C}$.

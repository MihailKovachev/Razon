>[!THEOREM] Theorem: Equality of Univariate Polynomials
>
>Let $A(x)$ and $B(x)$ be two [nonzero](../Zero%20Polynomial.md) [polynomials](Univariate%20Polynomial.md) over an [integral domain](../../Integral%20Domains/Integral%20Domain.md) with [degrees](../Degree%20of%20a%20Polynomial.md) $\deg(A)$ and $\deg(B)$.
>
>If $A(x)$ and $B(x)$ have the same [value](../Evaluation%20of%20a%20Polynomial.md) for $\max\{\deg(A), \deg(B)\}+1$ different values for $x$, then $A$ and $B$ are [equal](../Equality%20of%20Polynomials.md).

# Introduction

Classical mechanics is the oldest and most commonly encountered branch of [physics](../index.md). It studies the motion of every-day objects and describes the majority of phenomena which we observe. 

# Assumptions of Classical Mechanics

As with any physics model, classical mechanics is a simplification of the real world which makes certain assumptions in order to function. Whilst we have no way of deriving these assumptions, experimental observations indicate that they are correct or at least are good enough approximations for correctly describing most situations.

## Space and Time

Classical mechanics 

The biggest (and, surprisingly, most *in*correct) assumption which classical mechanics makes is that we live in a 3-dimensional space which is [homeomorphic](../../Mathematics/Topology/Continuity/Homeomorphisms/Homeomorphic%20Spaces.md) to the [Euclidean space](../../Mathematics/Geometry/Euclidean%20Geometry/Euclidean%20Space/index.md) $\mathbb{R}^3$. The details of what "homeomorphic to the Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^3$" means are irrelevant for the most part, but a very hand-wavy explanation is that space does not have intrinsic curvature and so the intuitive laws about distance and angles, such as the fact that the sum of the angles in a triangle is always $180 \degree$, are true.

However, this detail, although in no way minor, only comes into play under extreme conditions such as motion close to the speed of light or on the quantum scale.

## Symmetries

There are also certain **symmetries** which the world appears to exhibit.

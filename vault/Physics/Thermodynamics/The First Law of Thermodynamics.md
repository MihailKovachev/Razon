>The infinitesimal change $\mathrm{d} E_{\text{int}}$ in the [internal energy](Internal%20Energy.md) of a [physical system](../Physical%20Systems/Physical%20System.md) is the difference of the infinitesimal [heat](Heat.md) $\mathrm{d}Q \ge 0$ which [flows into](Heat%20Transfer.md) the system and the infinitesimal [work](../Mechanics/Classical%20Mechanics/Newtonian%20Formalism/Energy/Work.md) $\mathrm{d}W \ge 0$ which the system does on its [environment](../Physical%20Systems/Physical%20System.md).

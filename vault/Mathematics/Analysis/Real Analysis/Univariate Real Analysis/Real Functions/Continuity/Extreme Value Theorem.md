>[!THEOREM] The Extreme Value Theorem
>Let $f: D \subseteq \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ be a [real-valued function](../../Real-Valued%20Function.md) on a closed interval $D = [a;b]$.
>
>If $f$ is [continuous](Continuity.md) on $D$, then there exist at least one $x_{\text{of min}} \in D$ and at least one $x_{\text{of max}} \in D$ such that
>
>$$f(x_{\text{of min}}) \le f(x) \le f(x_{\text{of max}}) \qquad \forall x \in D$$
>
>>[!NOTE]
>>This theorem says that if a function is continuous on a closed interval, then it has a minimum and a maximum value on it.

>[!DEFINITION] Definition: Continuity
>A [real function](../Real%20Function.md) $f: D \subseteq \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ is **continuous at** $c \in D$ if its [limit](../Limits%20of%20Functions/Real%20Limits%20of%20a%20Function.md) as $x$ approaches $c$ is equal to its value for $c$:
>
>$$\lim_{x \to c} f(x) = f(c)$$
>
>If $f$ is continuous at every $c \in D$, then we say that $f$ is **continuous on** $D$.

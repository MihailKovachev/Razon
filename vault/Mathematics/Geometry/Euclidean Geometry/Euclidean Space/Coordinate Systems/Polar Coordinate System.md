# Polar Coordinates

Polar coordinates uniquely identify each point in the [Euclidean space](../index.md) $\mathbb{R}^2$ by its distance $r$ from the origin and the angle $\theta$ it makes with the $x$-axis.

## Conventions

Technically, each point has infinitely many polar coordinates, since adding or substracting a multiple of $2\pi$ to an angle has no effect. However, in order to have a [coordinate system](./index.md), coordinates must be unique which means that the range of values for $\theta$ needs to be restricted. The most common conventions for the possible values of $\theta$ are $[0;2\pi)$ and $(-\pi; \pi]$.

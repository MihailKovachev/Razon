>[!THEOREM] Theorem: Effects of Row and Column Operations on Determinants
>
>For any [square matrix](../Square%20Matrix.md) $A \in F^{n \times n}$:
>
>- Swapping two rows or two columns changes the algebraic sign of $A$'s [determinant](Determinant.md).
>- Multiplying a single row or a single column by $\lambda \in F$ results in $A$'s [determinant](Determinant.md) being multiplied by $\lambda$.
>- Adding a non-zero multiple of one row or column to another row or column has no effect on $A$'s [determinant](Determinant.md).

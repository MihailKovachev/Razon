>[!THEOREM] Theorem
>
>Let $(S, \tau_S)$ be a [subspace](Topological%20Subspace.md) of a [topological space](../Topological%20Spaces/Topological%20Space.md) $(X, \tau_X)$ and let $U$ be a [subset](../../Set%20Theory/Subset.md) of $S$.
>
>If $U$ is [open](../Topological%20Spaces/Open%20Subset.md) in $(S, \tau_S)$ and $S$ is [open](../Topological%20Spaces/Open%20Subset.md) $(X, \tau_X)$, then $U$ is also [open](../Topological%20Spaces/Open%20Subset.md) in $(X, \tau_X)$.

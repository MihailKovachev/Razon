>An **expression** over $\mathcal{A}$ is a [tuple](../../Set%20Theory/Tuple.md) of [symbols](Alphabets%20and%20Symbols.md) from $\mathcal{A}$.

>>[!NOTATION]-
>>
>>Expressions are usually written by listing their symbols directly, instead of placing them between parentheses in a comma-separated list, as is usually the case with tuples. For example, the expression $(a, 2, s, s, 1,w)$ is written as $a2ss1w$.
>>
>>The [set](../../Set%20Theory/Set.md) of all expressions which can be formed using the alphabet $\mathcal{A}$ is denoted by $\mathcal{A}^\ast$.

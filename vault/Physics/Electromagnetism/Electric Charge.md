## Elementary Charge

Experiments show that electric charge is discrete. It appears that all objects in the universe are only allowed to possess charge which is an integer multiple of a very specific value, called the **elementary charge**.

This is explained by the fact that matter is composed of atoms and ions which in turn consist of protons, neutrons and electrons. So far, all evidence suggests that the electron lacks internal structure - it is elementary, not composed of anything else, and intrinsically has charge $-e$. The proton and neutron, on the other hand, are comprised of quarks and gluons. However, the charges of these constituents add up in such a way that the proton has a net charge of $+e$ and the neutron has no net electric charge.

>Quarks possess fractional electric charge which is smaller in magnitude than the elementary charge $e$. However, quarks almost always appear in groups such that the net electric charge of the group is an integer multiple of $e$.

>Gluons have no electric charge.

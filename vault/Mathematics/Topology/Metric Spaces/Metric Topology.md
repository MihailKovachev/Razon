>The [collection](../../Set%20Theory/Collections/Collection.md) of all [open balls](Open%20Ball.md) in $M$ forms a [base](../Bases/Base%20for%20a%20Topological%20Space.md) $(M, \tau_d)$.

>>The [topology](../Topological%20Spaces/Topology.md) $\tau_d$ is known as the **metric topology** induced on $M$ by $d$.

>[!TIP] Corollary: Open Sets in the Metric Topology
>
>Let $(S,d)$ be a [metric space](Metric%20Space.md) and let $\tau$ be the [topology](.md) induced on it by $d$.
>
>A [subset](../../Set%20Theory/Subset.md) $U$ of $S$ is [open](../Topological%20Spaces/Open%20Subset.md) if and only if for each $u \in U$ there exists an [open ball](Open%20Ball.md) $B_\varepsilon (u)$ which is contained entirely in $U$.

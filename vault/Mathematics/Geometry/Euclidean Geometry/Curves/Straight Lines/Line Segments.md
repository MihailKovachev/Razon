# Line Segments

>[!DEFINITION] Definition: Line Segment
>
>A **line segment** is a [curve](../index.md) which has no [curvature](../Curvature.md) and has a [parametrization](../../../../Analysis/Real%20Analysis/Real%20Vector%20Functions/Parametric%20Curves/Parametric%20Curve.md) of the form $\gamma: [a;b] \to \mathbb{R}^n$.

>>[!NOTATION]-

>>If $A = \gamma(a)$ and $B = \gamma(b)$, then we denote the line segment as

>>AB \qquad \overline{AB} \qquad BA \qquad \overline{BA}

## Extension

>[!THEOREM] Theorem: Extension of a Line Segment
>
>For each [line segment](../Straight%20Lines/Line%20Segments.md) $s$ there exists one and only one [straight line](Straight%20Line.md) $l$ which contains $l$, i.e. $s \subset l$.

# Midpoint

>[!DEFINITION] Definition: Midpoint
>
>The **midpoint** of a [line segment](../Straight%20Lines/Line%20Segments.md) is the [point](../../Euclidean%20Space/Points%20vs%20Vectors/index.md) which divides it into two [congruence](../../Congruence.md) line segments.

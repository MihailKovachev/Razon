>[!DEFINITION] Definition: Straight Line
>
>A **straight line** (or just **line**) is an [unbounded](../Bounded%20Curve.md) [curve](../Curves.md) whose [curvature](../Curvature.md) is zero everywhere.
>
>>[!NOTATION]-
>>
>>Straight lines are usually denoted with lowercase Latin letters: $a,b,c, p,q, m,n,l,$ etc.
>>
>>If we know two points $A$ and $B$ which lie on the line, then we can also denote the line as either of the following:
>>
>>$$
>>AB \qquad \overline{AB} \qquad BA \qquad \overline{BA}
>>$$

>[!THEOREM] Theorem: Straight Line through Two Points
>
>If $P_1$ and $P_2$ are two distinct [points](../../Euclidean%20Geometry.md) in $n$-dimensional [Euclidean space](../../../../Analysis/Real%20Analysis/The%20Topology%20of%20Euclidean%20Space.md), then there exists one and only one [straight line](Straight%20Line.md) $l$ which contains both points, i.e. $P_1 \in l$ and $P_2 \in l$.

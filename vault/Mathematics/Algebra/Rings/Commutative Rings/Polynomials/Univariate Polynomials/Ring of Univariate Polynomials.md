>[!THEOREM] Theorem: Ring of Univariate Polynomials
>
>Let $R$ be a [commutative ring](../../Commutative%20Ring.md).
>
>The [set](../../../../../Set%20Theory/Set.md) of all [univariate polynomials](Univariate%20Polynomial.md) over $R$ form a commutative ring together with [polynomial addition](../Polynomial%20Addition.md) and [polynomial multiplication](../Polynomial%20Multiplication.md).

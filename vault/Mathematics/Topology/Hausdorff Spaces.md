# Hausdorff Spaces

>[!DEFINITION] Definition: Hausdorff Space
>
>A [topological space](Topological%20Spaces.md) $(X,\tau)$ is a **Hausdorff space** iff for all distinct points $p_1,p_2 \in X$ there are [disjoint](../../Set%20Theory/Disjoint%20Sets.md) [neighbourhoods](Topological%20Spaces.md) $N(p_1)$ of $p_1$ and $N(p_2)$ of $p_2$.
>
>>[!NOTE]
>>
>>Hausdorff spaces are also known as **$T_2$ spaces**.

## Properties

>[!THEOREM] Theorem: Closedness of Compact Hausdorff Subspaces
>
>Every [](Compactness/index.md#^compactness-of-a-topological-space) [subspace](Topological%20Subspaces.md) of a [Hausdorff space](Hausdorff%20Spaces.md) $(H,\tau_H)$ is [closed](Topological%20Spaces.md) in $(H,\tau_H)$.

>[!THEOREM] Theorem: Finite Subsets of Hausdorff Spaces are Closed
>
>Every finite [subset](../Set%20Theory/Sets.md) of a [Hausdorff space](Hausdorff%20Spaces.md) is [closed](Topological%20Spaces.md).
>
>>[!PROOF]-
>>
>>Let $(X, \tau)$ be a [Hausdorff space](Hausdorff%20Spaces.md).
>>
>>Let $\{p_0\}$ contain only the point $p_0 \in X$. By definition, given any other point $p \in X$, there exists [disjoint](../../Set%20Theory/Disjoint%20Sets.md) [neighbourhoods](Topological%20Spaces.md) $N(p_0)$ and $N(p)$.

>[!THEOREM] Theorem: Limits of Sequences in Hausdorff Spaces
>
>If a [sequence](../../Analysis/Functions/Sequences/Sequences.md) $(x_n)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ of points in a [Hausdorff space](Hausdorff%20Spaces.md) is [convergent](../../Analysis/Functions/Sequences/Convergence%20of%20Sequences.md), then it has a unique [limit](../../Analysis/Functions/Sequences/Limit%20of%20a%20Sequence.md).

>A **monoid** $(M, \circ)$ is a [set](../Set%20Theory/index.md) $M$ equipped with a binary [operation](../Analysis/Functions/index.md) $\circ: M \times M \to M$ which has the following properties.
>- Associativity: $(a \circ b) \cdot c = a \circ (b \circ c)$
>- Existence of an identity element: $\exists e \in M: a \circ e = e \circ a = a$

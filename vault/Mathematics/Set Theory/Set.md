# Specifying Sets

There are three main ways to represent and define sets.

The *descriptive form* uses words to describe a set. For example, the set $S$ is the set of all odd natural numbers which are less than 12.

The *set-builder form* defines a set by specifying a condition that all of its members satisfies and looks like this:

$$
\text{set} = \{\text{ placeholder }|\text{ condition }\}
$$

The placeholder is simply there so you can use it to more easily write the condition. The `|` character can be read as "such that". For example, specifying the aforementioned set $S$ using set-builder notation will look like the following.

$$
S = \{s|s \text{ is an odd number and } 0 \lt s \lt 12\}
$$

The final way to define a set is simply by listing all of its elements or listing enough of them, so that whoever is reading the definition can easily establish the pattern they follow. For example, the aforementioned set will be written as

$$
S = \{1,3,5,7,9,11\}
$$

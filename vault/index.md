# Welcome to Razon!

## What is Razon?

Razon is a knowledge repository whose goal is to serve as a free educational resource for anyone who wants to self-study science or merely supplement their university / high school courses.

## Razon's Structure

Razon has a non-linear structure which means that its content obeys no particular order. Instead, it is highly interconnected via links and you can easily hop from one note to another. This is especially useful, for example, when you are reading a note and an unknown concept pops up - simply click on it and you will be redirected to the note containing the concept's definition.

**Folders in Razon are very loosely organised - if you are trying to navigate Razon through folders, then you are doing it wrong!**

### Maps of Content

*Some* linearity does often come in handy, hence why Razon includes Maps of Content (MOCs) at various levels. These differ from canvases due to their plain text nature. You can think of an MOC as a "shopping list" of notes you need to read (and a suggestion about the order in which to read them) in order to learn about a specific topic.

Maps of Content can be identified by the `Index (MOC)` part of their name.

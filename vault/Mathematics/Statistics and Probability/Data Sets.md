# Data Sets

We need a way to organize statistical data.

Each element of a data set represents a value that was measured for a [random variable](TODO) and its multiplicity is the number of times this value was measured.

>The **(absolute) frequency** of the $i$-th data point in a [data set](Data%20Sets.md) is its [multiplicity](../Set%20Theory/Multisets.md).

>[!DEFINITION] Definition: Relative Frequency

>The **relative frequency** of the $i$-th data point in a [data set](Data%20Sets.md) $S$ is the ratio of its [absolute frequency](Data%20Sets.md) to the [cardinality](../Set%20Theory/Multisets.md) of the data set.

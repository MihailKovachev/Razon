>[!DEFINITION] Definition: Absolute Convergence of an Infinite Series
>
>An [infinite series](../Infinite%20Series.md) $\displaystyle \sum_{k = 1}^\infty a_k$ is **absolutely convergent**, if the [series](../Infinite%20Series.md) $\displaystyle \sum_{k = 1}^\infty |a_k|$ [converges](Convergence%20of%20an%20Infinite%20Series.md).

>[!THEOREM] Theorem: Absolute Convergence $\implies$ Convergence

>Every [absolutely convergent](Absolute%20Convergence%20of%20Infinite%20Series.md) [infinite series](../Infinite%20Series.md) is also [convergent](Convergence%20of%20an%20Infinite%20Series.md).

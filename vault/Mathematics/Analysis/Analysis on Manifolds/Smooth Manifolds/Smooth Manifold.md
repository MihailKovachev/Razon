>[!DEFINITION] Definition: Smooth Manifold
>
>A **smooth manifold** $(M, \mathcal{S})$ is a [manifold](../../../Geometry/Manifolds/Manifold.md) $M$ equipped with a [smooth structure](Smooth%20Structure.md) $\mathcal{S}$.
>
>>[!NOTE]
>>
>>Although a smooth manifold technically has two components - a manifold $M$ and a smooth structure $\mathcal{S}$, - if $\mathcal{S}$ is understood from context we usually this technicality and just call $M$ a smooth manifold.

>>[!NOTE]
>>
>>Smooth manifolds are also known as **differentiable manifolds**.

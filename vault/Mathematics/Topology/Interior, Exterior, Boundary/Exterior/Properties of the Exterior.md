>>The [exterior](Exterior.md) of $S$ is the [complement](../../../Set%20Theory/Complement.md) of its [closure](../Closure.md) and since the [closure](../Closure.md) is a [closed set](../../Topological%20Spaces/Closed%20Subset.md), the [exterior](Exterior.md) is [open](../../Topological%20Spaces/Open%20Subset.md).

>The [open subsets](../../../Topology/Topological%20Spaces/Open%20Subset.md) of the [Euclidean space](Euclidean%20Space.md) $\mathbb{R}^n$ are precisely the following:
>- All [open balls](Open%20Balls%20in%20Euclidean%20Space.md);
>- All [unions](../../../Set%20Theory/Collections/Union%20of%20a%20Collection.md) of arbitrary [collections](../../../Set%20Theory/Collections/Collection.md) of [open balls](Open%20Balls%20in%20Euclidean%20Space.md);
>- All [intersections](../../../Set%20Theory/Collections/Intersection%20of%20a%20Collection.md) of finite [collections](../../../Set%20Theory/Collections/Collection.md) of [open balls](Open%20Balls%20in%20Euclidean%20Space.md).

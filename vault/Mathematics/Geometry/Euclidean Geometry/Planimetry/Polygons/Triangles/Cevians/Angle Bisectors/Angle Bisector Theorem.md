>[!THEOREM] Angle Bisector Theorem
>
>In a [triangle](../../Triangle.md) the [angle bisector](../../../../../Angles/Plane%20Angles/Angle%20Bisector%20of%20a%20Plane%20Angle.md) of each [interior angle](../../../Interior%20Angle.md) divides the opposite [side](../../../Polygon.md) into two [segments](../../../../../Curves/Line%20Segments/Line%20Segment.md) whose ratio is the same as the ratio of their adjacent sides.

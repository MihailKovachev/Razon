>[!DEFINITION] Definition: Equation
>
>Let $X$ and $Y$ be two not necessarily unique [sets](../../Set%20Theory/Sets.md) such that $Y$ has an [equivalence relation](../../Set%20Theory/Relations/Equivalence%20Relation.md) $E_Y$ defined on it.
>
>An **equation** over $X$ is an [expression](../../Formal%20Logic/Formal%20Languages.md) of the form
>
>$$
>f(x) = g(x),
>$$
>
>where $f,g: X \to Y$ are arbitrary [functions](../../Analysis/Functions/Functions.md).

>>[!DEFINITION] Definition: Solution
>>
>>A **solution** to the equation is any $x^\ast \in X$ such that $f(x^\ast) \,\, E_Y \,\, g(x^\ast)$.

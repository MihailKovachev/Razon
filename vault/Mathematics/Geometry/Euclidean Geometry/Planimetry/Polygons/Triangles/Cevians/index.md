>[!DEFINITION] Definition: Cevian
>
>A **cevian** in a [triangle](../index.md) is a [line segment](../../../../Curves/Straight%20Lines/Line%20Segments.md) whose endpoints are a [vertex](../../index.md) of the triangle and a [point](../../../../Euclidean%20Space/Points%20vs%20Vectors/index.md) on the [side](../../index.md) not containing it.

>Let $T$ be a [triangle](../index.md) with [sides](../../index.md) $a,b,c$.

>If a [cevian](./index.md) divides $a$ into two [segments](../../../../Curves/Straight%20Lines/Line%20Segments.md) $m$ and $n$ such that $n$ shares a [vertex](../../index.md) with $b$ and $m$ shares a vertex with $c$, then for the length $d$ of the cevian it holds that

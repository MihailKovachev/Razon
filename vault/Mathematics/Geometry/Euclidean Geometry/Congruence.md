>[!DEFINITION] Definition: Congruence
>
>Two [geometric figures](../Geometric%20Figure.md) $G_1$ and $G_2$ are **congruent** if there exists an [isometry](../../Topology/Metric%20Spaces/Isometry.md) which maps $G_1$ onto $G_2$.

>>The two geometric figures are congruent if there is a way to move and rotate one of them in such a way so as to make it coincide with the other figure.

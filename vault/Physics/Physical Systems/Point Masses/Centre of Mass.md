>[!DEFINITION] Definition: Centre of Mass
>
>The **centre of mass** of a [physical system](Physical%20System.md) of [point masses](Point%20Mass.md) is an imaginary [point mass](Point%20Masses/Point%20Mass.md) whose mass $M$ is the sum of the masses $m_1,m_2,\cdots$ of its components and whose [position](../../Kinematics/Translation/Position.md) $\boldsymbol{r}_\text{cm}$ is the mass-weighted average of the [positions](../../Kinematics/Translation/Position.md) $\boldsymbol{r}_1,\boldsymbol{r}_2,\cdots$ of its components:

>$$M \overset{\text{def}}{=} \sum_{k}m_k \qquad \boldsymbol{r}_\text{cm} \overset{\text{def}}{=} \frac{1}{M} \sum_k m_k\boldsymbol{r}_k$$

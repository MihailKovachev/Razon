>[!DEFINITION] Definition: Evaluation of a Polynomial
>
>Let $P(x_1, \cdots, x_n)$ be a [polynomial](Polynomial.md) over a [commutative ring](../Commutative%20Ring.md) $R$.
>
>The **value** or **evaluation** of $P$ at an $n$-[Tuple](../../../../Set%20Theory/Tuple.md) $(r_1, \cdots, r_n)$, where $r_1, \cdots, r_n \in R$, is obtained by replacing $x_i$ with $r_i$ and carrying out all ring operations.

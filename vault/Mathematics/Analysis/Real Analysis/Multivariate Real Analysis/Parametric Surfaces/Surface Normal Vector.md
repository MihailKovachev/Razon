>Let $s: \mathcal{D} \subseteq \mathbb{R}^2 \to \mathbb{R}^3$ be a [parametric surface](Parametric%20Surface.md) which is [differentiable](../Real%20Vector%20Functions/Differentiation/Differentiability%20of%20Real%20Vector%20Functions.md) at $\mathbf{a}$.

>The **normal vector** of $s$ at $\mathbf{a}$ is the [cross product](../../../../Algebra/Linear%20Algebra/Matrices/Row%20and%20Column%20Vectors/Real%20Vectors/Real%20Cross%20Product.md) of $s$'s [partial derivatives](../Real%20Vector%20Functions/Differentiation/Partial%20Derivatives%20of%20Real%20Vector%20Functions.md) with respect to [Cartesian coordinates](../../../../Geometry/Euclidean%20Geometry/Euclidean%20Space/Coordinate%20Systems/Cartesian%20Coordinate%20System.md):

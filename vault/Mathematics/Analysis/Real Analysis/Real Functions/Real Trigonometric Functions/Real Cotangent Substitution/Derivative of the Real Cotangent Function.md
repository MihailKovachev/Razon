>[!THEOREM] Theorem: Derivative of the Real Cotangent Function

>The [real cotangent function](Real%20Cotangent%20Function.md) is [differentiable](../../Differentiation/index.md) (everywhere it is defined) and its [derivative](../../Differentiation/index.md) is the negative reciprocal of the square of the [real sine function](../Real%20Sine%20Function/Real%20Sine%20Function.md):

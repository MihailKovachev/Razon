>[!DEFINITION] Definition: Entropy
>
>The **entropy** of a [physical system](../../Physical%20Systems/Physical%20System.md) is defined as the product of the [Boltzmann constant](Boltzmann%20Constant.md) $k_B$ and the natural logarithm of the [multiplicity](../../Physical%20Systems/Multiplicity.md) $\Omega$ of the [system](../../Physical%20Systems/Physical%20System.md)'s [macrostate](../../Physical%20Systems/Microstate%20and%20Macrostate.md).

# Local Homeomorphisms

>[!DEFINITION] Definition: Local Homeomorphism
>
>Let $(X, \tau_X)$ and $(Y,\tau_Y)$ be [topological spaces](../../Topological%20Spaces/index.md).
>
>A **local homeomorphism** is a [function](../../../Analysis/Functions/Functions.md) $f: X \to Y$ such that every $x \in X$ has an [open](../../Topological%20Spaces/Open%20Sets.md) [neighbourhood](../../Topological%20Spaces/Neighborhoods.md) $O$ whose [image](../../../Analysis/Functions/Functions.md) $f(O)$ is [open](../../Topological%20Spaces/Open%20Sets.md) and for which the [restriction](../../../Analysis/Functions/Restriction.md) $f\big|_O$ is a [homeomorphism](./index.md) between the [subspaces](../../Topological%20Subspaces.md) $O$ and $f(O)$.

## Properties

>[!THEOREM]- Theorem
>
>A [local homeomorphism](Local%20Homeomorphisms.md) is a [homeomorphism](./index.md) if and only if it is [bijective](../../../Analysis/Functions/Types%20of%20Functions/Bijection.md).

>[!THEOREM] Theorem: Limits of Sequences in Hausdorff Spaces
>
>If a [sequence](../../Analysis/Functions/Sequences/Sequence.md) $(x_n)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ of points in a [Hausdorff space](Hausdorff%20Space.md) is [convergent](../../Analysis/Functions/Sequences/Convergence%20of%20Sequences.md), then it has a unique [limit](../../Analysis/Functions/Sequences/Limit%20of%20a%20Sequence.md).

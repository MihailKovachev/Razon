>[!THEOREM] Theorem: Ideal Gas Law
>
>The [pressure](../../../Mechanics/Pressure.md) $p$ which an [ideal gas](Kinetic-Molecular%20Model%20of%20an%20Ideal%20Gas.md) exerts on the walls of the container it occupies is related to the volume $V$, the temperature $T$ of the gas and the number of gas particles $N$ by the equation:
>
>$$
>pV = k_BNT,
>$$
>
>where $k_B$ is the [Boltzmann constant](../../Boltzmann%20Constant.md).
>
>>[!NOTE]
>>
>>Alternatively, the law can be expressed via the [molar gas constant](Molar%20Gas%20Constant.md) $R$ and the amount of substance $n$:

>>pV = nRT

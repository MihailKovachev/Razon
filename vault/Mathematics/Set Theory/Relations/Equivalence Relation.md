>[!DEFINITION] Definition: Equivalence Relation
>
>An **equivalence relation** on the [set](../Set.md) $A$ is any [relation](Relation.md) $R \subseteq A \times A$ which is [reflexive](Reflexivity.md), [transitive](Transitivity.md) and [symmetric](Symmetry.md).

>>Equivalence relations are usually denoted with $\sim$ instead of $R$.

>>[!INTUITION]-
>>
>>The statement $x\sim y$ means that $x$ is equal to $y$ in the sense of $\sim$.

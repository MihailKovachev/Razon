>[!DEFINITION] Definition: Vector
>
>A **vector** in $n$-dimensional [Euclidean space](../Euclidean%20Space.md) is a [real column vector](../../../Algebra/Linear%20Algebra/Matrices/Row%20and%20Column%20Vectors/Real%20Vectors/Real%20Vector.md) $\mathbb{R}^n$.

>>[!INTUITION]-
>>
>>In geometry, we tend to think of vectors as arrows which point from the origin to some location in space, i.e. we think of vectors as having a [length](Length%20of%20a%20Vector.md) and a direction. This way of thinking is especially useful in $3$ and $2$ dimensions, since it can be easily visualised.

>[!NOTATION] Notation: Vector between Points

>If $P$ and $Q$ are two [points](Points%20in%20Geometry.md), then we use $\overrightarrow{PQ}$ to denote the [vector](../../../Algebra/Linear%20Algebra/Matrices/Row%20and%20Column%20Vectors/Real%20Vectors/Real%20Vector.md) $Q - P$.

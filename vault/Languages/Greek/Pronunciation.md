# Pronunciation

In modern Greek, there is a one-to-one correspondence between each [letter](Orthography.md) and the sound it makes with very few exceptions.

>[!IMPORTANT] Important: The letter σ
>
>When letter σ precedes one of β, γ, δ, μ, ν, ρ, then it is pronounced as /z/. This happens even at word boundaries, meaning that a word ending in ς precedes a word starring with one of the aforementioned letters.
>
>>[!EXAMPLE]-
>>
>>σβήνω /zvino/
>>
>>κόσμος /kozmos/
>>
>>τους δύο /tuz ðio/
>>
>

>[!IMPORTANT] Important: /n p/ -> /mb/, /n t/ -> /nd/, /n k/ -> /ŋg/
>
>When a word is supposed to end in /n/ and the next one is supposed to start with /p/, the glide between them is pronounced simply as /mb/. Similarly, /n t/ becomes /n d/ and /n k/ turns into /ŋg/.
>
>>[!EXAMPLE]-
>>
>>τον πόνο /tom.'bo.no/
>>
>>τον τόνο /ton.'do.no/
>>
>>την καρδιά /tiŋ.gaɾ.'ðia/

# Stress

The stress of a word in modern Greek always falls on one of the last the syllables called the "antepenult", "penult" and "ultima". This stress is indicated by placing an [acute accent](Orthography.md#Diacritics) over the stressed syllable.

>A **local homeomorphism** is a [function](../../../Analysis/Functions/Function.md) $f: X \to Y$ such that every $x \in X$ has an [open](../../Topological%20Spaces/Open%20Subset.md) [neighbourhood](../../Topological%20Spaces/Neighbourhoods.md) $O$ and the [restriction](../../../Analysis/Functions/Restriction.md) $f\big|_O$ is a [homeomorphism](Homeomorphism.md) between the [subspace](../../Subspaces/Topological%20Subspace.md) $O$ and some open subspace of $Y$.

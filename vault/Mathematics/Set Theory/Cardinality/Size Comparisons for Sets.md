>We say that:
>- the [cardinality](./index.md) of $A$ is **equal** to the [cardinality](./index.md) of $B$, written as $|A| = |B|$, if there is a [bijection](../../Analysis/Functions/Injections,%20Surjections%20and%20Bijections.md) from $A$ to $B$;
>- the [cardinality](./index.md) of $A$ is **less than or equal** to the [cardinality](./index.md) of $B$, written as $|A| \le |B|$, if there is an [injection](../../Analysis/Functions/Injections,%20Surjections%20and%20Bijections.md) between $A$ and $B$;
>- the [cardinality](./index.md) of $A$ is **less than** the [cardinality](./index.md) of $B$, written as $|A| \lt |B|$, if there is an [injection](../../Analysis/Functions/Injections,%20Surjections%20and%20Bijections.md) but no [bijection](../../Analysis/Functions/Injections,%20Surjections%20and%20Bijections.md) from $A$ to $B$.

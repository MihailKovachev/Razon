>[!DEFINITION] Definition: Convergence of an Infinite Series
>
>An [infinite series](../Infinite%20Series.md) $\displaystyle \sum_{k=1}^\infty a_k$ is said to **converge to** $L \in \mathbb{R}$ if it is a [sequence](../../Real%20Sequences/Real%20Sequence.md) which [approaches](../../Real%20Sequences/Limits%20of%20Sequences/Convergence%20of%20Real%20Sequences.md) $L$.
>
>If $\displaystyle \sum_{k=1}^\infty a_k$ converges to $L$, then we call $L$ the **value** of the infinite series.

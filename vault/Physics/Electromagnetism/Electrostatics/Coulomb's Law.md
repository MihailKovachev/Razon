>[!LAW] Empirical Law: Coulomb's Law
>
>Every pair of [point charges](Point%20Charge.md) $q_1$ and $q_2$ which are at rest relative to one another interact with a pair of **electrostatic [forces](../../Mechanics/Force.md)** which depend on the [charges](Electric%20Charge.md) $q_1$ and $q_2$,  the distance $r$ between them and the [permittivity](Permittivity.md) $\varepsilon$ of their environment.
>
>- Magnitude - both $q_1$ and $q_2$ experience the same magnitude of [force](../../Mechanics/Force.md):
>
>$$
>\frac{1}{4 \pi \varepsilon}\frac{|q_1 q_2|}{r^2}
>$$
>
>- Direction - the electrostatic [force](../../Mechanics/Force.md) always acts along the line joining $q_1$ and $q_2$. It is repulsive if both [charges](../Electric%20Charge.md) have the same algebraic sign, and it is attractive if they have different signs.

>Coulomb's law can be expressed in vector form as follows:

>$$
>\boldsymbol{F}_{2 \text{ on } 1} = \frac{1}{4\pi\varepsilon}\frac{q_1 q_2}{r^2}\hat{\boldsymbol{r}}_{2 \text{ to } 1}

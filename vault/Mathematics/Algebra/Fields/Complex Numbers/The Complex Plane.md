>[!DEFINITION] Definition: The Complex Plane
>
>The **complex plane** is a Cartesian coordinate system whose horizontal axis is the real number line and whose vertical axis is the [imaginary](Imaginary%20Number.md) line.
>
>Every [complex number](Complex%20Numbers.md) $z = a + \mathrm{i}b$ corresponds to the point $(a;b)$ on the complex plane.

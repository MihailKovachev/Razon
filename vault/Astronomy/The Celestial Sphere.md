# Introduction

All celestial bodies, except the Sun and the Moon, are so far away that simple observation of the sky cannot actually discern differences in the distance between the Earth and them. In fact, they all look like bright dots of light on the sky. However, we still need a way to map the sky and describe the positions of celestial bodies.

To achieve this, we introduce the concept of the **celestial sphere**.

>The **celestial sphere** is an imaginary sphere of arbitrary radius whose centre is at the center of the Earth.

We imagine that all celestial bodies are positioned on the surface of this sphere and then use various angles to describe their location, ignoring the distance between us and them.

>[!THEOREM]
>
>Let $(X, \tau)$ be a [topological space](../Topological%20Spaces/Topological%20Space.md) and let $S$ be a [subset](../../Set%20Theory/Subset.md) of $X$.
>
>If $S$ can be expressed as the [union](../../Set%20Theory/Collections/Union%20of%20a%20Collection.md) of a [collection](../../Set%20Theory/Collections/Collection.md) $\mathcal{C}$ of [](Connectedness.md#^connected-subset) [subsets](../../Set%20Theory/Subset.md) whose [intersection](../../Set%20Theory/Collections/Intersection%20of%20a%20Collection.md) is [nonempty](../../Set%20Theory/The%20Empty%20Set.md),  then $S$ is also [](Connectedness.md#^connected-subset).

>>The notation used for sequences is a bit different than the typical notation used for functions.

>>Let $f: D \to X$ be a [sequence](Sequence.md). Instead of writing $f: D \to X$, we usually  say that $f$ is a sequence of points in $X$ and write $(x_k)_{k \in D}$ instead of $f$. Given a specific $d \in D$, we write $x_d$ instead of $f(d)$.

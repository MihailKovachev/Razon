>[!THEOREM] Theorem: Coefficient of Performance of the Carnot Refrigerator
>
>No [refrigerator](Refrigerator.md) can have a higher [coefficient of performance](Coefficient%20of%20Performance.md) than that of the [Carnot refrigerator](Carnot%20Refrigerator.md), which is given by the [temperature](../Temperature.md) $T_\text{C}$ of the [cold reservoir](Refrigerator.md) and the temperature $T_\text{H}$ of the [hot reservoir](Refrigerator.md).

>[!THEOREM] Theorem: Polynomial Division
>
>Let $R$ be a [commutative ring](../../Commutative%20Ring.md) and let $A(x)$ and $B(x)$ be two [univariate polynomials](Univariate%20Polynomial.md) over $R$ such that the [degree](../Degree%20of%20a%20Polynomial.md) of $A$ is greater than or equal to the degree of $B$.
>
>If $B(x)$ is [nonzero](../Zero%20Polynomial.md), then there exist unique polynomials $Q(x)$ and $R(x)$ such that
>
>$$
>A(x) = Q(x)B(x) + R(x),
>$$
>
>where 
>- $\deg(Q) = \deg(A) - \deg(B)$
>- $\deg(R) \lt \deg(B)$ or $R(x)$ is the zero polynomial.
>
>We call $A$ the **dividend**, $B$ the **divisor**, $Q$ the **quotient** and $R$ the **remainder**.

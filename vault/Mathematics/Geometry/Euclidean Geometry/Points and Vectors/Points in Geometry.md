>A **point** in the [Euclidean space](../Euclidean%20Space.md) $\mathbb{R}^n$ is a [real column vector](../../../Algebra/Linear%20Algebra/Matrices/Row%20and%20Column%20Vectors/Real%20Vectors/Real%20Vector.md).

>>
>>- Points are usually denoted with capital Latin letters *without* an arrow: $P,Q,K,L,$ etc.
>>- Instead of writing $P = \begin{bmatrix}p_1 & \cdots & p_n\end{bmatrix}^\mathsf{T}$, we often write points as $n$-[tuples](../../../Set%20Theory/Tuple.md) $P = (p_1, \cdots, p_n)$.

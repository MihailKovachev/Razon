# Continuity

>[!DEFINITION] Definition: Continuity of Complex Functions
>
>A [complex function](../index.md) $f: \mathcal{D} \subseteq \mathbb{C} \to \mathbb{C}$ is **continuous at** $c \in \mathcal{D}$ iff its [limit](Limits.md) for $z \to c$ is equal to its value there.
>
>$$
>\lim_{z \to c} f(z) = f(c)

# Properties

>[!THEOREM] Theorem: Continuity of the Real and Imaginary Parts
>
>Let $f: \mathcal{D} \subseteq \mathbb{C} \to \mathbb{C}$ be a [complex function](../index.md). 
>
>If $f$ is [continuous](./index.md) at $z_0 \in \mathbb{C}$.

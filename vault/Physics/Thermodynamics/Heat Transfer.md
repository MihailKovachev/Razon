>[!LAW] Empirical Law: Heat Transfer
>
>Two [physical systems](../Physical%20Systems/Physical%20System.md) which are *not* at [thermal equilibrium](Thermal%20Equilibrium.md) will interact with each other and exchange [kinetic energy](../Mechanics/Classical%20Mechanics/Newtonian%20Formalism/Energy/Kinetic%20Energy.md) until such an equilibrium is reached.

>This process is called **heat transfer** - we say that [heat](Heat.md) *flows* from the system with higher [temperature](Temperature.md) into the system with lower [temperature](Temperature.md).
>- When [heat](Heat.md) flows *out* of a [physical system](../Physical%20Systems/Physical%20System.md), the system loses [kinetic energy](../Mechanics/Classical%20Mechanics/Newtonian%20Formalism/Energy/Kinetic%20Energy.md) and so [heat](Heat.md) is considered negative - from the point of view of the system with higher [temperature](Temperature.md), [heat](Heat.md) is negative, since the total [kinetic energy](../Mechanics/Classical%20Mechanics/Newtonian%20Formalism/Energy/Kinetic%20Energy.md) of the system *decreases* during heat transfer.
>- When [heat](Heat.md) flows *into* a [physical system](../Physical%20Systems/Physical%20System.md), the system gains [kinetic energy](../Mechanics/Classical%20Mechanics/Newtonian%20Formalism/Energy/Kinetic%20Energy.md) and so [heat](Heat.md) is considered positive - from the point of view of the system with lower [temperature](Temperature.md), [heat](Heat.md) is positive, since the total [kinetic energy](../Mechanics/Classical%20Mechanics/Newtonian%20Formalism/Energy/Kinetic%20Energy.md) of the system *increases* during heat transfer.

>>
>>Let $(X, \tau)$ be a [Hausdorff space](Hausdorff%20Space.md).
>>
>>Let $\{p_0\}$ contain only the point $p_0 \in X$. By definition, given any other point $p \in X$, there exists [disjoint](../../Set%20Theory/Disjoint%20Sets.md) [neighbourhoods](../Topological%20Spaces/Neighbourhoods.md) $N(p_0)$ and $N(p)$.

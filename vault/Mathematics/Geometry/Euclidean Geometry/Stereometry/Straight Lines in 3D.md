# Straight Lines in 3D

>[!DEFINITION] Definition: Perpendicularity
>
>Two [straight lines](Straight%20Lines%20in%203D.md) in 3D are **perpendicular** if the angle between them is a right angle.
>

## Parallel Lines

>[!THEOREM]- Theorem: Parallel Lines and Points
>
>If $a$ is a [straight line](Straight%20Lines%20in%203D.md) in [3D space](Stereometry.md), then for each point $P$ there exists a unique [straight line](Straight%20Lines%20in%203D.md) $b$ which goes through $P$ and is [parallel](TODO) to $a$.

>$$
>\forall P, \exists! b: a \parallel b \land P \in b

>[!THEOREM]- Theorem: Parallel Lines $\implies$ Plane
>
>If two [straight lines](Straight%20Lines%20in%203D.md) in [3D space](Stereometry.md) are [parallel](TODO), then there exists a unique [plane](../Surfaces/Planes.md) which contains both of them.

>If two [straight lines](Straight%20Lines%20in%203D.md) in [3D space](Stereometry.md) are [parallel](TODO), then every [plane](../Surfaces/Planes.md) which intersects one of them also intersects the other.

>Let $a,b,c$ be [straight lines](Straight%20Lines%20in%203D.md) in [3D space](Stereometry.md).

>If $a$ and $b$ are [parallel](Straight%20Lines%20in%203D.md#Parallel%20Lines) and $b$ and $c$ are [parallel](Straight%20Lines%20in%203D.md#Parallel%20Lines), then $a$ and $c$ are also [parallel](Straight%20Lines%20in%203D.md#Parallel%20Lines).

## Skew Lines

>[!DEFINITION] Definition: Skew Lines
>
>**Skew lines** are two [straight lines](../Curves/Straight%20Lines/Straight%20Line.md) in [3D space](Stereometry.md) which do not lie in the same [plane](../Surfaces/Planes.md).

>[!THEOREM] Theorem: Angle between Skew Lines
>
>Let $a$ and $b$ be [skew lines](Straight%20Lines%20in%203D.md#Skew%20Lines), let $a_1$ and $a_2$ be [parallel](Straight%20Lines%20in%203D.md#Parallel%20Lines) to $a$ and let $b_1$ and $b_2$ be [parallel](Straight%20Lines%20in%203D.md#Parallel%20Lines) to $b$.
>
>If $a_1$ and $b_1$ intersect and $a_2$ and $b_2$ also intersect, then the [angles](../Curves/Straight%20Lines/Angle%20between%20Lines.md) they form are equal.

>>[!DEFINITION] Definition: Angle between Skew Lines
>>
>>The **angle** between two [skew lines](Straight%20Lines%20in%203D.md) $a$ and $b$ is the [angle](../Curves/Straight%20Lines/Angle%20between%20Lines.md) between any pair of intersecting [lines](Straight%20Lines%20in%203D.md) $a'$ and $b'$ such that $a$ and $a'$ are [parallel](Straight%20Lines%20in%203D.md#Parallel%20Lines) and $b$ and $b'$ are also [parallel](Straight%20Lines%20in%203D.md#Parallel%20Lines).

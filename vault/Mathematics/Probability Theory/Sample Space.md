>>Flipping a coin is a very simple experiment whose sample space $S$ contains only two possible outcomes - the coin falls heads-up or the coin falls tails-up. Hence, $S$ is just

>>Another common experiment is the roll of a single six-sided die. There are six possible outcomes - the number on the die is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6. Hence, the sample space is

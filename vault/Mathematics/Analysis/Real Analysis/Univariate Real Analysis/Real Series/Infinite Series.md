>The [sequence](../Real%20Sequences/Real%20Sequence.md) $(S_n)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ of the [partial sums](Partial%20Sum.md) $S_n$ of a [real sequence](../Real%20Sequences/Real%20Sequence.md) $(a_n)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$.

>>$$\sum_{k=1}^\infty a_k$$

>>Although this notation suggest otherwise, we are *not* summing up an infinite number of elements - an infinite series is *not* a sum, it is a *sequence*.

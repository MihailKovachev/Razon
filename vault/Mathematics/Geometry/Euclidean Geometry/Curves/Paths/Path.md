>A **path** is a [curve](../Curve.md) which has a [parameterisation](../../../../Analysis/Real%20Analysis/Multivariate%20Real%20Analysis/Curve%20Parameterisations/Curve%20Parameterisation.md) $\gamma: I \subset \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}^n$ on a [closed](../../../../Set%20Theory/Ordering/Intervals.md), [bounded](../../../../Set%20Theory/Ordering/Bounds/Bounded%20Set.md) [interval](../../../../Set%20Theory/Ordering/Intervals.md) $I = [a;b]$.

>>The [points](../../Points%20and%20Vectors/Points%20in%20Geometry.md) $\gamma (a)$ and $\gamma (b)$ are called the **endpoints** of the path.

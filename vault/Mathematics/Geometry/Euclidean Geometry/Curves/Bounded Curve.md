>[!DEFINITION] Definition: Bounded Curve
>
>A [curve](./index.md) $\mathcal{C}$ is **bounded** if there exists an [open ball](../../../Topology/Metric%20Spaces/index.md) $B$ of finite radius which completely contains it, i.e. $\mathcal{C} \subseteq B$.
>
>>[!INTUITION]-
>>
>>This just means the curve is contained in a finite region of space, i.e. it does not extend infinitely in some direction. The open ball $B$ is like an $n$-dimensional sphere which completely envelopes the entire curve $\mathcal{C}$.

# Welcome to NavHub!
 
Welcome to the navigation hub of the [city of knowledge](../index.md#the%20city%20of%20knowledge). Here you will find *itineraries*. Each itinerary is essentially a map which you can follow in order to study a particular subject. Inside each itinerary you will find the pages which to read as well as the order in which to read them so as to learn the subject of interest. Since subjects can be vast, itineraries will most likely include prerequisites, i.e. topics which you should already know before following the itinerary's path. Such prerequisites will be clearly stated in the itinerary and may take the form of links to other itineraries or just links to the necessary concepts if they are not too many.

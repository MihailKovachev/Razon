>[!LAW] Empirical Law: Magnetic Force
>
>Every [point charge](../Electric%20Charge.md) $q$ moving through a [magnetic field](Magnetic%20Field.md) $\boldsymbol{B}$ with [velocity](../../Kinematics/Translation/Velocity.md) $\boldsymbol{v}$ experiences a **magnetic [force](../../Mechanics/Force.md)** $\boldsymbol{F}$:

>$$
>\boldsymbol{F} = q\, \boldsymbol{v} \times \boldsymbol{B}

>>[!NOTE] Note: Direction of the Magnetic Force
>>
>>The direction of $\boldsymbol{F}$ can be determined via the right hand rule. Point the index finger of your right hand in the direction of $\boldsymbol{v}$ and your middle finger in the direction of $\boldsymbol{B}$. If you now raise your thumb, it will point in the direction of $\boldsymbol{F}$.

>[!DEFINITION] Definition: Isolated Point

>Let $(X, \tau)$ be a [topological space](../Topological%20Spaces/index.md) and let $S$ be a [subset](../../Set%20Theory/Sets.md) of $X$.
>
>A point $p \in S$ is an **isolated point** of $S$ iff $p$ has a [neighbourhood](../Topological%20Spaces/Neighborhoods.md) $N(p)$ which does not contain any other points of $S$.

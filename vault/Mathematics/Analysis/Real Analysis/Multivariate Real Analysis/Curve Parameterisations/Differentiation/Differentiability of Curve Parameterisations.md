>[!TIP] Tip: Derivative of a Curve Parameterisation

>A [curve parameterisation](../Curve%20Parameterisation.md) has only one variable with respect to which one can take the [partial derivative](../../Real%20Vector%20Functions/Differentiation/Partial%20Derivatives%20of%20Real%20Vector%20Functions.md), hence why we call this partial derivative simply the **derivative** of the parameterisation.

>[!DEFINITION] Definition: Diameter of a Subset

>Let $(M, d)$ be a [metric space](./index.md) and let $S$ be a [subset](../../Set%20Theory/Sets.md) of $M$.
>
>The **diameter** of $S$ is the [supremum](../../Set%20Theory/Ordering/Boundedness.md) of all [](Distance%20in%20Metric%20Spaces.md#^distance-between-points) between points of $S$.

>[!DEFINITION] Definition: Elementary Row Operations
>
>**Elementary row operations** are the following manipulations which can be done on a [system of linear equations](System%20of%20Linear%20Equations.md) without changing its solutions:
>
>- Exchanging two rows (row swap)
>- Multiplying a row by a constant $\lambda \ne 0$ 
>- Adding a non-zero multiple of one row to another row
>

>[!THEOREM] Theorem: Elementary Matrix
>
>Each elementary row operation can by represented as the [matrix product](../Matrices/Matrix%20Operations/Matrix%20Product.md) of the [augmented matrix](Augmented%20Matrix.md) $(A|\vec{b}) \in K^{m \times n}$ of a [system of linear equations](System%20of%20Linear%20Equations.md) with a [matrix](../Matrices/Matrix.md) $E$, which is obtained by applying the row operation to the [identity matrix](../Matrices/Square%20Matrices/Identity%20Matrix.md) $I_m$.

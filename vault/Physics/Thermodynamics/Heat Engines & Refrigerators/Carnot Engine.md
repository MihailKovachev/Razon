>[!DEFINITION] Definition: Carnot Engine
>
>The **Carnot engine** is a [heat engine](Heat%20Engine.md) based on an [ideal gas](../Gases/Kinetic-Molecular%20Model%20of%20an%20Ideal%20Gas.md) which undergoes the following *Carnot cycle*:
>
>1. The gas expands [isothermally](../Gases/Gases%20in%20Thermodynamic%20Processes/Ideal%20Gases%20in%20Isothermal%20Processes.md) at [temperature](../Temperature.md) $T_\text{H}$, absorbing [heat](../Heat.md) $Q_\text{H}$.
>2. The gas expands [adiabatically](../Gases/Gases%20in%20Thermodynamic%20Processes/Ideal%20Gases%20in%20Adiabatic%20Processes.md) until its temperature drops to $T_\text{C}$.
>3. The gas is compressed isothermally at temperature $T_\text{C}$, releasing heat $|Q_\text{C}|$.
>4. The gas is compressed adiabatically back to temperature $T_\text{H}$.

>[!THEOREM] Theorem: Thermal Efficiency of the Carnot Engine
>
>No [heat engine](Heat%20Engine.md) can have a higher [thermal efficiency](Thermal%20Efficiency.md) than that of a [Carnot engine](Carnot%20Engine.md), which is given by the [temperature](../Temperature.md) $T_\text{H}$ of the [hot reservoir](Heat%20Engine.md) and the temperature $T_\text{C}$ of the [cold reservoir](Heat%20Engine.md) as follows:

>$$
>\eta_\text{Carnot} = \frac{T_\text{H} - T_\text{C}}{T_\text{H}}

>
>A [collision](Collision.md) is **inelastic** if the total [kinetic energy](../Energy/Kinetic%20Energy.md) of the two objects is lower after the [collision](Collision.md) than it was before it.
>
>>[!NOTE]
>>
>>This reduction of the [kinetic energy](../Energy/Kinetic%20Energy.md) can have various causes such as some of it being dissipated as heat, sound or even light.

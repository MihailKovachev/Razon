>[!DEFINITION] Definition: Upper Bound
>A real number $u \in \mathbb{R}$ is an **upper bound** of a [real-valued function](../Real-Valued%20Function.md) $f: D \to \mathbb{R}$ if
>
>$$f(x) \le u \qquad \forall x \in D$$

>[!DEFINITION] Definition: Lower Bound
>A real number $l \in \mathbb{R}$ is an **upper bound** of a [real-valued function](../Real-Valued%20Function.md) $f: D \to \mathbb{R}$ if
>
>$$l \le f(x) \qquad \forall x \in D$$

>[!DEFINITION] Definition: Bounded Function
>A [real-valued function](../Real-Valued%20Function.md) is:
>- **bounded above** if it has at least one upper bound;
>- **bounded below** if it has at least one lower bound;
>- **bounded** if it is bounded above and bounded below.

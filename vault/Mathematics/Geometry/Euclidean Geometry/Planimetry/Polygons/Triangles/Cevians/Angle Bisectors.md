>[!THEOREM] Angle Bisector Theorem

>In a [triangle](../index.md) the [angle bisector](../../../../Angles/Plane%20Angles/Angle%20Bisector%20of%20a%20Plane%20Angle.md) of each [interior angle](../../Interior%20Angle.md) divides the opposite [side](../../index.md) into two [segments](../../../../Curves/Straight%20Lines/Line%20Segments.md) whose ratio is the same as the ratio of their adjacent sides.

# Introduction

The command line, is a text-based interface which allows for interaction with the computer and execution of commands. The actual command interpreter which carries out the commands is referred to as the *shell* and there are multiple examples of shells such as `bash`, `zsh`, `sh`, etc.

# Input and Output Redirection

It is possible to redirect input and output from and to files when invoking commands:

|Redirection|Description|
|:-----:|:-------:|
|`< in_file`|Redirect `in_file` into the command's standard input.|
|`> out_file`|Redirect the command's standard output into `out_file` by overwriting it.|
|`>> out_file`|Redirect the command's standard output into `out_file` by appending to it.|
|`> err_file`|Redirect the command's standard error into `err_file` by overwriting it.|
|`>> err_file`|Redirect the command's standard error into `err_file` by appending to it.|

## Pipes

Moreover, information may be redirected directly from one command to another by using unnamed pipes (`|`).

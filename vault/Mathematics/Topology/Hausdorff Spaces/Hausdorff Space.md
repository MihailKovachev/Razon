>A [topological space](../Topological%20Spaces/Topological%20Space.md) $(X,\tau)$ is a **Hausdorff space** iff for all distinct points $p_1,p_2 \in X$ there are [disjoint](../../Set%20Theory/Disjoint%20Sets.md) [neighbourhoods](../Topological%20Spaces/Neighbourhoods.md) $N(p_1)$ of $p_1$ and $N(p_2)$ of $p_2$.

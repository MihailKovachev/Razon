>[!DEFINITION] Definition: Del Operator
>
>The **del operator** in $\mathbb{R}^n$ can be thought of as a [column vector](../../../../Algebra/Linear%20Algebra/Matrices/Row%20and%20Column%20Vectors/Real%20Vectors/Real%20Vector.md) whose $i$-th entry is the [partial derivative](../Real%20Vector%20Functions/Differentiation/Partial%20Derivatives%20of%20Real%20Vector%20Functions.md) symbol with respect to the $i$-th variable.

>>The derivative symbols are empty - they do not refer to a particular function. This is because the Del operator is used to operate on different [real vector functions](../Real%20Vector%20Functions/Real%20Vector%20Function.md) and, depending on the function in question, the partial derivatives will change.

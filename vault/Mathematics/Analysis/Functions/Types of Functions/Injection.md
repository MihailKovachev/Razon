>A [function](../Functions.md) $f: X \to Y$ is called **injective** if for each $y \in Y$ there is only one $x\in X$ such that $y = f(x)$.

>The **inverse function** of an [injection](Injection.md) $f: X \to Y$ is the [function](../Functions.md) $f^{-1}: f(X) \to X$ which to each $y \in Y$ assigns the $x \in X$ for which $y = f(x)$, i.e.

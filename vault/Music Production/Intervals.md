# Intervals

An **interval** in music is the ratio of the frequencies of two [pitches](Sound.md#Pitch). 

>[!NOTATION]

>Most commonly, intervals are denoted as reduced fractions with the colon sign such as $2:1$, $5:4$, $4:7$ etc. However, it is also possible to denote them by their decimal value, obtained after the division of the numbers such as $2$, $1.25$, $0.5$, etc. The latter is actually the only option when the ratio is an irrational number.

Depending on how the [sounds](Sound.md) are arranged temporally, we distinguish two types of intervals:
- **harmonic intervals** - we say that the interval between two [pitches](Sound.md#Pitch) is harmonic whenever they are playing simultaneously;
- **melodic intervals** - we say that the interval between two [pitches](Sound.md#Pitch) is melodic whenever they are to be played sequentially, one after the other.

Furthermore, we distinguish two types of melodic intervals:
- **ascending intervals** - an interval is ascending whenever it is a number greater than $1$, i.e. the second [pitch](Sound.md#Pitch) has a higher frequency than the first;
- **descending intervals** - an interval is descending whenever it is a number between $0$ and $1$, i.e. the second [pitch](Sound.md#Pitch) has a lower frequency than the first.

There are two fundamental [intervals](Intervals.md) which are crucial for all of music:

>[!DEFINITION] Definition: Unison

>A **(perfect) unison** is the [interval](Intervals.md) between two identical [pitches](Sound.md#Pitch), i.e. the [interval](Intervals.md) with value $1:1$.

>[!DEFINITION] Definition: Octave
>
>An **(perfect) octave** is the [interval](Intervals.md) between two [pitches](Sound.md#Pitch) where the frequency of one of the [pitches](Sound.md#Pitch) is exactly double the frequency of the other, i.e. the [interval](Intervals.md) with value $2:1$.

# Naming

For us humans, working directly with numbers is unintuitive and confusing. This is why we have devised a more comprehensible naming system for [intervals](Intervals.md).

>[!DEFINITION] Definition: Bounded Subset

>Let $(M, d)$ be a [metric space](./index.md) with the [metric topology](./index.md) induced on it by $d$.
>
>A [subset](../../Set%20Theory/Sets.md) $S \subseteq M$ is **bounded** if and only if there exists some [open ball](./index.md) $B$ such that $S \subseteq B$.

>A **circle** is a [closed](../../../Curves/Closed%20Curve.md) [plane curve](../index.md) in $\lambda$ for which there exists a [point](../../../Euclidean%20Space/Points%20vs%20Vectors/index.md) $O \in \lambda$ such that the [distance](../../../Euclidean%20Space/Points%20vs%20Vectors/Distance%20between%20Points.md) between $O$ and every point of the circle is the same.

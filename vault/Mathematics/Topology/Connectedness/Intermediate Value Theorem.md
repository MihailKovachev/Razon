>Let $(X, \tau_X)$ and $(Y, \tau_Y)$ be [topological spaces](../Topological%20Spaces/Topological%20Space.md).
>
>If $(X, \tau_X)$ is [](Connectedness.md#^connected-space), then its [image](../../Analysis/Functions/Function.md) $f(X)$ under any [continuous function](../Continuity/Continuity.md) $f: X \to Y$ is also [](Connectedness.md#^connected-subset).

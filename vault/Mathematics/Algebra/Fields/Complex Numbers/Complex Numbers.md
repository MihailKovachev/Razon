# Complex Numbers

>[!DEFINITION] Definition: Complex Number
>
>A **complex number** has the form $a + \mathrm{i}b$, where $\mathrm{i}$ is the [imaginary unit](The%20Imaginary%20Unit.md) and $a,b \in \mathbb{R}$ are real numbers.
>
>>[!NOTATION]-
>>
>>Complex numbers are usually denoted by $z$.
>>
>>The [set](../../../Set%20Theory/Set.md) of all complex numbers is $\mathbb{C}$.
>>
>
>>[!DEFINITION] Definition: Real Part

# The Forms of a Complex Number

>[!DEFINITION] Definition: Cartesian Form of Complex Numbers
>
>The **cartesian form** of a [complex number](Complex%20Numbers.md) $z$ is just its usual form $z = a+\mathrm{i}b$.

>[!DEFINITION] Definition: Polar Form of a Complex Number
>
>The **polar form** of a [complex number](Complex%20Numbers.md) $z$ is
> 
>$$
>z = r(\cos \varphi + \mathrm{i}\sin \varphi),
>$$
>
>where $r$ is the [magnitude](Absolute%20Value%20of%20a%20Complex%20Number.md) of $z$ and $\varphi$ is its [argument](Argument%20of%20a%20Complex%20Number.md).

>[!DEFINITION] Definition: Exponential Form of a Complex Number
>
>The **exponential form** of a [complex number](Complex%20Numbers.md) $z$ is $r\mathrm{e}^{\mathrm{i}\varphi}$, where $r$ is the [magnitude](Absolute%20Value%20of%20a%20Complex%20Number.md) of $z$ and $\varphi$ is its [argument](Argument%20of%20a%20Complex%20Number.md).

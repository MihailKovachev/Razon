>Let $(X, \tau_X)$ and $(Y, \tau_Y)$ be [topological spaces](../Topological%20Spaces/index.md).

>A [function](../../Analysis/Functions/Functions.md) $f: X \to Y$ is a **closed map** iff the [image](../../Analysis/Functions/Functions.md) of every [closed subset](../Topological%20Spaces/Closed%20Sets.md) of $(X, \tau_X)$ is [closed](../Topological%20Spaces/Closed%20Sets.md) in $(Y, \tau_Y)$.

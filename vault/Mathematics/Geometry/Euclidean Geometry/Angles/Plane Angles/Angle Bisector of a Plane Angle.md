>[!THEOREM] Theorem: Angle Bisector of a Plane Angle
>
>Let $\angle(a;b)$ be the [plane angle](Plane%20Angle.md) formed by two [rays](../../Curves/Rays/Ray.md) $a$ and $b$.
>
>There exists one and only one [straight line](../../Curves/Lines/Straight%20Line.md) $l$ in the [plane](../../Surfaces/Planes/Plane.md) of $\angle(a;b)$ which goes through the [vertex](Plane%20Angle.md) of $\angle(a;b)$ such that the angles $\angle(a; l)$ and $\angle (l; b)$ are [congruent](../../Congruence.md).

>>The **angle bisector** of a [plane angle](Plane%20Angle.md) is the unique [straight line](../../Curves/Lines/Straight%20Line.md) which lies in the [plane](../../Surfaces/Planes/Plane.md) of the angle, goes through its vertex and divides it into two [congruent](../../Congruence.md) angles.

>[!DEFINITION] Definition: Cauchy Sequence
>A [real sequence](../Real%20Sequence.md) $(a_n)_{n\in\mathbb{N}}$ is called a **Cauchy sequence** if for every $\varepsilon \gt 0$ there is an integer $N \in \mathbb{N}$ such that

>$$|a_m - a_n| \lt \varepsilon \qquad \forall m,n \ge N$$

>[!THEOREM] Theorem: Convergence of Cauchy Sequences
>Every Cauchy sequence [converges](Convergence%20of%20Real%20Sequences.md).
